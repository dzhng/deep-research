It was formulated and advanced by American [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher \"Philosopher\") and [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician \"Logician\") [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce \"Charles Sanders Peirce\") beginning in the latter half of the 19th century.\\n\\nAbductive reasoning, unlike [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\"), yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it. Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as \"best available\" or \"most likely\". While [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") draws general conclusions that apply to many situations, abductive conclusions are confined to the particular observations in question.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law,[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-3) [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"), and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") research[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Josephson,_Magnani-4) spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction.[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-5)\\nDiagnostic [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system \"Expert system\") frequently employ abduction.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-6)\\n\\n## Deduction, induction, and abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Deduction, induction, and abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning \"Logical reasoning\")\\n\\n### Deduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Deduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\")\\n\\nDeductive reasoning allows deriving b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) from a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) only where b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) is a formal [logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence \"Logical consequence\") of a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc). In other words, deduction derives the consequences of the assumed. Given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion. For example, given that \"Wikis can be edited by anyone\" (a1{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a\\\\_{1}}![{\\\\displaystyle a_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bbf42ecda092975c9c69dae84e16182ba5fe2e07)) and \"Wikipedia is a wiki\" (a2{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a\\\\_{2}}![{\\\\displaystyle a_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/270580da7333505d9b73697417d0543c43c98b9f)), it follows that \"Wikipedia can be edited by anyone\" (b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3)).\\n\\n### Induction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Induction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\")\\n\\nInductive reasoning is the process of inferring some _general_ principle b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) from a body of knowledge a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc), where b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) does not necessarily follow from a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc). a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) might give us very good reason to accept b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) but does not ensure b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3). For example, if it is given that 95% percent of the elephants are gray, and Louise is an elephant, one can _induce_ that Louise is gray. Still, this is not necessarily the case: 5 percent of the time this conclusion will be wrong.[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-:0-7)\\n\\nHowever, an inference being derived from statistical data is not sufficient to classify it as inductive. For example, if all swans that a person has observed so far are white, they may instead _abduce_ the possibility that all swans are white. They have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise because it is the _best explanation_ for their observations, and the truth of the conclusion is still not guaranteed. (Indeed, it turns out that [some swans are black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan \"Black swan\").)[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-:0-7)\\n\\n### Abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nAbductive reasoning allows inferring a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) as an explanation of b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3). As a result of this inference, abduction allows the precondition a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) to be abducted from the consequence b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3). [Deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\") and abductive reasoning thus differ in which end, left or right, of the proposition \"a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc)[entails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entailment \"Entailment\")b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3)\" serves as conclusion. For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the eight ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that _best explains_ our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability \"Prior probability\") in [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics \"Bayesian statistics\").\\n\\nOne can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation,[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-8) although not all usages of the terms _abduction_ and _inference to the best explanation_ are equivalent.[\\\\[9\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-9)[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-10)\\n\\n## Formalizations of abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Formalizations of abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\n### Logic-based abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Logic-based abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic \"Logic\"), [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation \"Explanation\") is accomplished through the use of a [logical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_theory \"Logical theory\")T{\\\\\\\\displaystyle T}![{\\\\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0) representing a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse \"Domain of discourse\") and a set of observations O{\\\\\\\\displaystyle O}![{\\\\displaystyle O}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d70e1d0d87e2ef1092ea1ffe2923d9933ff18fc).

This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation.\\\\[ _[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_\\\\] Under this principle, an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data. The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance (see [Occam\\'s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science \"Science\"); moreover, Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought:\\n\\n> Looking out my window this lovely spring morning, I see an azalea in full bloom. No, no! I don\\'t see that; though that is the only way I can describe what I see. That is a proposition, a sentence, a fact; but what I perceive is not proposition, sentence, fact, but only an image, which I make intelligible in part by means of a statement of fact. This statement is abstract; but what I see is concrete. I perform an abduction when I so much as express in a sentence anything I see. The truth is that the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction. Not the smallest advance can be made in knowledge beyond the stage of vacant staring, without making an abduction at every step.[\\\\[13\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-13)\\n\\nIt was Peirce\\'s own maxim that \"Facts cannot be explained by a hypothesis more extraordinary than these facts themselves; and of various hypotheses the least extraordinary must be adopted.\"[\\\\[14\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-14) After obtaining possible hypotheses that may explain the facts, abductive validation is a method for identifying the most likely hypothesis that should be adopted.\\n\\n### Subjective logic abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Subjective logic abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\n[Subjective logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_logic \"Subjective logic\") generalises [probabilistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic \"Probabilistic logic\") by including degrees of epistemic [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification \"Uncertainty quantification\") in the input arguments, i.e. instead of probabilities, the analyst can express arguments as [subjective opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_logic \"Subjective logic\"). Abduction in subjective logic is thus a generalization of probabilistic abduction described above.[\\\\[15\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Josang2016-SL-15) The input arguments in subjective logic are subjective opinions which can be binomial when the opinion applies to a binary variable or multinomial when it applies to an _n_-ary variable.

Over the years he called such inference _hypothesis_, _abduction_, _presumption_, and _retroduction_. He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy, not in purely formal or mathematical logic, and eventually as a topic also in economics of research.\\n\\nAs two stages of the development, extension, etc., of a hypothesis in scientific [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\"), abduction and also [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") are often collapsed into one overarching concept—the hypothesis. That is why, in the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method \"Scientific method\") known from [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei \"Galileo Galilei\") and [Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon \"Francis Bacon\"), the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction. Thus, in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper \"Karl Popper\")\\'s explication of the [hypothetico-deductive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model \"Hypothetico-deductive model\"), where the hypothesis is considered to be just \"a guess\"[\\\\[17\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-17) (in the spirit of Peirce). However, when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this \"guess\" has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis. Indeed, many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage.\\n\\nBefore 1900, Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation. For instance: it is a known rule that, if it rains, grass gets wet; so, to explain the fact that the grass on this lawn is wet, one _abduces_ that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules that might explain the observation are not taken into account—e.g. the grass could be wet from [dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew \"Dew\"). This remains the common use of the term \"abduction\" in the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science \"Social science\") and in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\").\\n\\nPeirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation, though an unassured one, for some very curious or surprising (anomalous) observation stated in a premise. As early as 1865 he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference; in the 1900s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction. In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years.[\\\\[18\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-18)\\n\\nIn later years his view came to be:\\n\\n- Abduction is guessing.[\\\\[19\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-guess-19) It is \"very little hampered\" by rules of logic.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20) Even a well-prepared mind\\'s individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right.[\\\\[21\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-21) But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) (some speak of [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition \"Logical intuition\") in such contexts[\\\\[23\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-23)).\\n- Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible, instinctive, economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon. That is its proximate aim.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22)\\n- Its longer aim is to economize [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") itself. Its rationale is inductive: it works often enough, is the only source of new ideas, and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths.[\\\\[24\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-24) Its rationale especially involves its role in coordination with other modes of inference in inquiry. It is inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying.\\n- [Pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") is the logic of abduction. Upon the generation of an explanation (which he came to regard as instinctively guided), the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general.

Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles, predicates, and subjects. For example: All _men_ \\\\[middle\\\\] are _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]; _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is a _man_ \\\\[middle\\\\]; ergo _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]\". Below, \\'M\\' stands for a middle; \\'P\\' for a predicate; \\'S\\' for a subject.

In the forms themselves, it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a \"very curious circumstance\". The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another\\'s propositions (without the bracketed hints shown below).\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Deduction.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Result:_ These beans are white. | Induction.<br>_Case:_ These beans are \\\\[randomly selected\\\\] from this bag. <br>_Result:_ These beans are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. | Hypothesis.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Result:_ These beans \\\\[oddly\\\\] are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. |\\n\\n#### _A Theory of Probable Inference_ (1883)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: A Theory of Probable Inference (1883)\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits (weighed, not counted like objects), explicitly so in his influential 1883 \"A theory of probable inference\", in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion.[\\\\[37\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Pierce-1883-37) Like \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" in 1878, it was widely read (see the historical books on statistics by [Stephen Stigler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stigler \"Stephen Stigler\")), unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction. Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances.\\n\\n[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes \"Sherlock Holmes\") used this method of reasoning in the stories of [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle \"Arthur Conan Doyle\"), although Holmes refers to it as \" [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\")\".[\\\\[38\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-38)[\\\\[39\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-39)[\\\\[40\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-40)\\n\\n#### _Minute Logic_ (1902) and after\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Minute Logic (1902) and after\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1902 Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension (i.e., objects and characters as referenced by terms), as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought.[\\\\[41\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-41) In 1903 he offered the following form for abduction:[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20)\\n\\n> The surprising fact, C, is observed;\\n>\\n> But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.\\n\\nThe hypothesis is framed, but not asserted, in a premise, then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion. Thus, as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form, the conclusion is formulated from some premise(s). But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed. Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises, but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences, or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis; either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts.\\n\\nNote that the hypothesis (\"A\") could be of a rule. It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation (\"C\"), which needs to follow only as a \"matter of course\"; or the \"course\" itself could amount to some known rule, merely alluded to, and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity. In the same year, Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts, so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely.[\\\\[35\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-newidea-35)\\n\\nPeirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the 1903 form. In 1911, he wrote, \"I do not, at present, feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all \\'Retroductions\\'. For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind.\"[\\\\[36\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-kehler-36)\\n\\n#### Pragmatism\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Pragmatism\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1901 Peirce wrote, \"There would be no logic in imposing rules, and saying that they ought to be followed, until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them.\"[\\\\[42\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-42) In 1903 Peirce called [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") \"the logic of abduction\" and said that the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general.[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) The pragmatic maxim is:\\n\\n> Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\\n\\nIt is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object\\'s conceived effects. Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction\\'s purpose in inquiry, the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct. In various writings in the 1900s[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28)[\\\\[43\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-43) he said that the conduct of abduction (or retroduction) is governed by considerations of economy, belonging in particular to the economics of research. He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic (that is, theory of inquiry).[\\\\[44\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-44)\\n\\n#### Three levels of logic about abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Three levels of logic about abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce came over the years to [divide (philosophical) logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_the_sciences_(Peirce)#Sciences \"Classification of the sciences (Peirce)\") into three departments:\\n\\n1. Stechiology, or speculative grammar, on the conditions for meaningfulness. Classification of signs (semblances, symptoms, symbols, etc.) and their combinations (as well as their objects and [interpretants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretant \"Interpretant\")).\\n2. Logical critic, or logic proper, on validity or justifiability of inference, the conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various modes (deduction, induction, abduction).\\n3. Methodeutic, or speculative rhetoric, on the conditions for determination of interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its interplay of modes.\\n\\nPeirce had, from the start, seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and, by the 1900s, held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion, one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found, predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis. That is [Peirce\\'s outline of the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#Scientific_method \"Charles Sanders Peirce\") of inquiry, as covered in his inquiry methodology, which includes [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") or, as he later called it, [pragmaticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmaticism \"Pragmaticism\"), the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice.\\n\\n##### Classification of signs\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Classification of signs\")\\\\]\\n\\nAs early as 1866,[\\\\[45\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-45) Peirce held that:\\n\\n1\\\\. Hypothesis (abductive inference) is inference through an _icon_ (also called a _likeness_).\\n\\n2\\\\. Induction is inference through an _index_ (a sign by factual connection); a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn.\\n\\n3\\\\. Deduction is inference through a _symbol_ (a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object).\\n\\nIn 1902, Peirce wrote that, in abduction: \"It is recognized that the phenomena are _like_, i.e. constitute an Icon of, a replica of a general conception, or Symbol.\"[\\\\[46\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-46)\\n\\n##### Critique of arguments\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Critique of arguments\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments (as discussed above), and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural. In 1908 Peirce described this plausibility in some detail.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) It involves not likeliness based on observations (which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis), but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo\\'s natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\" (Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role; taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all). Even a well-prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right, but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry, and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature, an affinity between the mind\\'s processes and the processes of the real, which would account for why appealingly \"natural\" guesses are the ones that oftenest (or least seldom) succeed; to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since, without \"a natural bent like nature\\'s\", people would have no hope of understanding nature. In 1910 Peirce made a three-way distinction between probability, verisimilitude, and plausibility, and defined plausibility with a normative \"ought\": \"By plausibility, I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably.\"[\\\\[47\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-47) For Peirce, plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities, or on verisimilitude, or even on testability, which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference _as_ an inference, but rather a question of the hypothesis\\'s relation to the inquiry process.\\n\\nThe phrase \"inference to the best explanation\" (not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference) is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses (such as those with the [fewest assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). However, in other senses of \"best\", such as \"standing up best to tests\", it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form, since one has not tested it yet. Still, for Peirce, any justification of an abductive inference as \"good\" is not completed upon its formation as an argument (unlike with induction and deduction) and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise (such as its testability) in advancing inquiry.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27)[\\\\[48\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-48)\\n\\n##### Methodology of inquiry\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Methodology of inquiry\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26) for testing because it offers, via its trial, to expedite and economize the [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") process itself toward new truths, first of all by being testable and also by further economies,[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28) in terms of cost, value, and relationships among guesses (hypotheses). Here, considerations such as probability, absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level, come into play. For examples:\\n\\n- Cost: A simple but low-odds guess, if low in cost to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing, to get it out of the way. If surprisingly it stands up to tests, that is worth knowing early in the inquiry, which otherwise might have stayed long on a wrong though seemingly likelier track.\\n- Value: A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctual plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [subjective likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_probability \"Subjective probability\"), though reasoned, can be treacherous.\\n- Interrelationships: Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically for their\\n  - _caution_, for which Peirce gave as an example the game of [Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions \"Twenty Questions\"),\\n  - _breadth_ of applicability to explain various phenomena, and\\n  - _incomplexity_, that of a hypothesis that seems too simple but whose trial \"may give a good \\'leave\\', as the billiard-players say\", and be instructive for the pursuit of various and conflicting hypotheses that are less simple.[\\\\[49\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ2-49)\\n\\n#### Uberty\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Uberty\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce[\\\\[50\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-50) indicated that abductive reasoning is driven by the need for \"economy in research\"—the expected fact-based productivity of hypotheses, prior to deductive and inductive processes of verification. A key concept proposed by him in this regard is \" [uberty](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uberty \"wiktionary:uberty\")\"[\\\\[51\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-51)—the expected fertility and pragmatic value of reasoning. This concept seems to be gaining support via association to the [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle \"Free energy principle\").[\\\\[52\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-52)\\n\\n### Gilbert Harman (1965)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Gilbert Harman (1965)\")\\\\]\\n\\n[Gilbert Harman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Harman \"Gilbert Harman\") was a professor of philosophy at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University \"Princeton University\").

The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the prior [web of beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_belief \"Web of belief\"), while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent. The process of updating the web of beliefs can be done by the use of abduction: once an explanation for the observation has been found, integrating it does not generate inconsistency.\\n\\nGärdenfors’ paper[\\\\[58\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-G%C3%A4rdenfors-58) contains a brief survey of the area of belief revision and its relation to updating of logical databases, and explores the relationship between belief revision and nonmonotonic logic.\\n\\nThis use of abduction is not straightforward, as adding [propositional formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_formula \"Propositional formula\") to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse. Instead, abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world \"Possible world\"). Preference models use [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic \"Fuzzy logic\") or [utility models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_models \"Utility models\").\\n\\n### Philosophy of science\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit section: Philosophy of science\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science \"Philosophy of science\"), abduction has been the key inference method to support [scientific realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_realism \"Scientific realism\"), and much of the debate about scientific realism is focused on whether abduction is an acceptable method of inference.[\\\\[59\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-59)\\n\\n### Historical linguistics\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit section: Historical linguistics\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [historical linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics \"Historical linguistics\"), abduction during language acquisition is often taken to be an essential part of processes of [language change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change \"Language change\") such as reanalysis and [analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy \"Analogy\").[\\\\[60\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-60)\\n\\n### Applied linguistics\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit section: Applied linguistics\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [applied linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_linguistics \"Applied linguistics\") research, abductive reasoning is starting to be used as an alternative explanation to inductive reasoning, in recognition of anticipated outcomes of qualitative inquiry playing a role in shaping the direction of analysis. It is defined as \"The use of an unclear premise based on observations, pursuing theories to try to explain it\" (Rose et al., 2020, p.\\xa0258)[\\\\[61\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-61)[\\\\[62\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-62)\\n\\n### Anthropology\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: Anthropology\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology \"Anthropology\"), [Alfred Gell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gell \"Alfred Gell\") in his influential book _Art and Agency_ defined abduction (after Eco[\\\\[63\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-63)) as \"a case of synthetic inference \\'where we find some very curious circumstances, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt that supposition\\'\".[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) Gell criticizes existing \"anthropological\" studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering \"social relationships\", specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced, circulated, and received.[\\\\[65\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-65) Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency. That is, abduction can explain how works of art inspire a _sensus communis:_ the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\nThe question Gell asks in the book is, \"how does it initially \\'speak\\' to people?\" He answers by saying that \"No reasonable person could suppose that art-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of [semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis \"Semiosis\").\"[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) However, he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre-established existence of the _sensus communis_ that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art. Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept (Peirce likened it to guessing) means that not only can it operate outside of any pre-existing framework, but moreover, it can actually intimate the existence of a framework. As Gell reasons in his analysis, the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality. A statue of a goddess, for example, in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder; and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions (which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence). Therefore, through abduction, Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths. The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\n### Computer programming\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Computer programming\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods \"Formal methods\"), logic is used to specify and prove properties of computer programs. Abduction has been used in mechanized reasoning tools to increase the level of automation of the proof activity.\\n\\nA technique known as bi-abduction, which mixes abduction and the [frame problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem \"Frame problem\"), was used to scale reasoning techniques for memory properties to millions of lines of code;[\\\\[67\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-67) logic-based abduction was used to infer pre-conditions for individual functions in a program, relieving the human of the need to do so. It led to a program-proof startup company, which was acquired by Facebook,[\\\\[68\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-68) and the Infer program analysis tool, which led to thousands of bugs being prevented in industrial codebases.[\\\\[69\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-69)\\n\\nIn addition to inference of function preconditions, abduction has been used to automate inference of invariants for program loops,[\\\\[70\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-70) inference of specifications of unknown code,[\\\\[71\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-71) and in synthesis of the programs themselves.[\\\\[72\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-72)\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=36 \"Edit section: See also\")\\\\]\\n\\n- ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/36px-Socrates.png)[Philosophy portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Philosophy \"Portal:Philosophy\")\\n\\n- [Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument \"Argument\")\\xa0– Attempt to persuade or to determine the truth of a conclusion\\n- [Argumentation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory \"Argumentation theory\")\\xa0– Academic field of logic and rhetoric\\n- [Attribution (psychology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology) \"Attribution (psychology)\")\\xa0– Process by which individuals explain causes of behavior and events\\n- [Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce_bibliography \"Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography\")\\n- [Critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking \"Critical thinking\")\\xa0– Analysis of facts to form a judgment\\n- [Defeasible reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning \"Defeasible reasoning\")\\xa0– Reasoning that is rationally compelling, though not deductively valid\\n- [Douglas N.

There is then a two-fold problem with the claim that abduction is IBE. On the one hand, it conflates abduction and induction, which are two distinct forms of logical inference, with two distinct aims, as shown by Charles S.

While [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") draws general conclusions that apply to many situations, abductive conclusions are confined to the particular observations in question.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law,[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-3) [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"), and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") research[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Josephson,_Magnani-4) spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction.[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-5)\\nDiagnostic [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system \"Expert system\") frequently employ abduction.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-6)\\n\\n## Deduction, induction, and abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Deduction, induction, and abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning \"Logical reasoning\")\\n\\n### Deduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Deduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\")\\n\\nDeductive reasoning allows deriving b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) from a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) only where b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) is a formal [logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence \"Logical consequence\") of a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc). In other words, deduction derives the consequences of the assumed. Given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

For example, if it is given that 95% percent of the elephants are gray, and Louise is an elephant, one can _induce_ that Louise is gray. Still, this is not necessarily the case: 5 percent of the time this conclusion will be wrong.[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-:0-7)\\n\\nHowever, an inference being derived from statistical data is not sufficient to classify it as inductive. For example, if all swans that a person has observed so far are white, they may instead _abduce_ the possibility that all swans are white. They have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise because it is the _best explanation_ for their observations, and the truth of the conclusion is still not guaranteed.

For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the eight ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that _best explains_ our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability \"Prior probability\") in [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics \"Bayesian statistics\").\\n\\nOne can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation,[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-8) although not all usages of the terms _abduction_ and _inference to the best explanation_ are equivalent.[\\\\[9\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-9)[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-10)\\n\\n## Formalizations of abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Formalizations of abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\n### Logic-based abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Logic-based abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic \"Logic\"), [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation \"Explanation\") is accomplished through the use of a [logical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_theory \"Logical theory\")T{\\\\\\\\displaystyle T}![{\\\\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0) representing a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse \"Domain of discourse\") and a set of observations O{\\\\\\\\displaystyle O}![{\\\\displaystyle O}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d70e1d0d87e2ef1092ea1ffe2923d9933ff18fc).

This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation.\\\\[ _[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_\\\\] Under this principle, an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data. The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance (see [Occam\\'s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science \"Science\"); moreover, Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought:\\n\\n> Looking out my window this lovely spring morning, I see an azalea in full bloom. No, no! I don\\'t see that; though that is the only way I can describe what I see. That is a proposition, a sentence, a fact; but what I perceive is not proposition, sentence, fact, but only an image, which I make intelligible in part by means of a statement of fact. This statement is abstract; but what I see is concrete. I perform an abduction when I so much as express in a sentence anything I see. The truth is that the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction.

Over the years he called such inference _hypothesis_, _abduction_, _presumption_, and _retroduction_. He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy, not in purely formal or mathematical logic, and eventually as a topic also in economics of research.\\n\\nAs two stages of the development, extension, etc., of a hypothesis in scientific [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\"), abduction and also [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") are often collapsed into one overarching concept—the hypothesis. That is why, in the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method \"Scientific method\") known from [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei \"Galileo Galilei\") and [Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon \"Francis Bacon\"), the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction. Thus, in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper \"Karl Popper\")\\'s explication of the [hypothetico-deductive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model \"Hypothetico-deductive model\"), where the hypothesis is considered to be just \"a guess\"[\\\\[17\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-17) (in the spirit of Peirce). However, when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this \"guess\" has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis. Indeed, many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage.\\n\\nBefore 1900, Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation. For instance: it is a known rule that, if it rains, grass gets wet; so, to explain the fact that the grass on this lawn is wet, one _abduces_ that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules that might explain the observation are not taken into account—e.g. the grass could be wet from [dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew \"Dew\"). This remains the common use of the term \"abduction\" in the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science \"Social science\") and in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\").\\n\\nPeirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation, though an unassured one, for some very curious or surprising (anomalous) observation stated in a premise. As early as 1865 he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference; in the 1900s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction. In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years.[\\\\[18\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-18)\\n\\nIn later years his view came to be:\\n\\n- Abduction is guessing.[\\\\[19\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-guess-19) It is \"very little hampered\" by rules of logic.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20) Even a well-prepared mind\\'s individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right.[\\\\[21\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-21) But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) (some speak of [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition \"Logical intuition\") in such contexts[\\\\[23\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-23)).\\n- Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible, instinctive, economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon. That is its proximate aim.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22)\\n- Its longer aim is to economize [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") itself. Its rationale is inductive: it works often enough, is the only source of new ideas, and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths.[\\\\[24\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-24) Its rationale especially involves its role in coordination with other modes of inference in inquiry. It is inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying.\\n- [Pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") is the logic of abduction. Upon the generation of an explanation (which he came to regard as instinctively guided), the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have conceivable[\\\\[25\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-25) implications for informed practice, so as to be testable[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) and, through its trials, to expedite and economize inquiry. The economy of research is what calls for abduction and governs its art.[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28)\\n\\nWriting in 1910, Peirce admits that \"in almost everything I printed before the beginning of this century I more or less mixed up hypothesis and induction\" and he traces the confusion of these two types of reasoning to logicians\\' too \"narrow and formalistic a conception of inference, as necessarily having formulated judgments from its premises.\"[\\\\[29\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-29)\\n\\nHe started out in the 1860s treating hypothetical inference in a number of ways which he eventually peeled away as inessential or, in some cases, mistaken:\\n\\n- as inferring the occurrence of a character (a characteristic) from the observed combined occurrence of multiple characters which its occurrence would necessarily involve;[\\\\[30\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NCA-30) for example, if any occurrence of _A_ is known to necessitate occurrence of _B, C, D, E_, then the observation of _B, C, D, E_ suggests by way of explanation the occurrence of _A_. (But by 1878 he no longer regarded such multiplicity as common to all hypothetical inference.[\\\\[31\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-DIH-31) [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_13/August_1878/Illustrations_of_the_Logic_of_Science_VI))\\n- as aiming for a more or less probable hypothesis (in 1867 and 1883 but not in 1878; anyway by 1900 the justification is not probability but the lack of alternatives to guessing and the fact that guessing is fruitful;[\\\\[32\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L2L-32) by 1903 he speaks of the \"likely\" in the sense of nearing the truth in an \"indefinite sense\";[\\\\[33\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-33) by 1908 he discusses _plausibility_ as instinctive appeal.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22)) In a paper dated by editors as _circa_ 1901, he discusses \"instinct\" and \"naturalness\", along with the kind of considerations (low cost of testing, logical caution, breadth, and incomplexity) that he later calls methodeutical.[\\\\[34\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-34)\\n- as induction from characters (but as early as 1900 he characterized abduction as guessing[\\\\[32\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L2L-32))\\n- as citing a known rule in a premise rather than hypothesizing a rule in the conclusion (but by 1903 he allowed either approach[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20)[\\\\[35\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-newidea-35))\\n- as basically a transformation of a deductive categorical syllogism[\\\\[31\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-DIH-31) (but in 1903 he offered a variation on _modus ponens_ instead,[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20) and by 1911 he was unconvinced that any one form covers all hypothetical inference[\\\\[36\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-kehler-36)).\\n\\n#### _The Natural Classification of Arguments_ (1867)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: The Natural Classification of Arguments (1867)\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1867, Peirce\\'s \"On the Natural Classification of Arguments\",[\\\\[30\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NCA-30) hypothetical inference always deals with a cluster of characters (call them _P′, P′′, P′′′,_ etc.) known to occur at least whenever a certain character ( _M_) occurs. Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles, predicates, and subjects. For example: All _men_ \\\\[middle\\\\] are _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]; _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is a _man_ \\\\[middle\\\\]; ergo _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]\". Below, \\'M\\' stands for a middle; \\'P\\' for a predicate; \\'S\\' for a subject. Peirce held that all deduction can be put into the form of the categorical [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism \"Syllogism\") [Barbara (AAA-1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism#Barbara_(AAA-1) \"Syllogism\").\\n\\n> |     |     |     |\\n> | --- | --- | --- |\\n> | \\\\[Deduction\\\\].<br>\\\\[Any\\\\] M is P <br>\\\\[Any\\\\] S is M <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22) \\\\[Any\\\\] S is P. | Induction.<br>_S′, S′′, S′′′_, &c. are taken at random as _M\\'_ s; <br>_S′, S′′, S′′′_, &c. are _P_: <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22) Any _M_ is probably _P_. | Hypothesis.<br>Any _M_ is, for instance, _P′, P′′, P′′′,_ &c.; <br>_S_ is _P′, P′′, P′′′,_ &c.: <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_S_ is probably _M_. |\\n\\n#### _Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis_ (1878)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis (1878)\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1878, in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\",[\\\\[31\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-DIH-31) there is no longer a need for multiple characters or predicates in order for an inference to be hypothetical, although it is still helpful. Moreover, Peirce no longer poses hypothetical inference as concluding in a _probable_ hypothesis. In the forms themselves, it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a \"very curious circumstance\". The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another\\'s propositions (without the bracketed hints shown below).\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Deduction.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Result:_ These beans are white. | Induction.<br>_Case:_ These beans are \\\\[randomly selected\\\\] from this bag. <br>_Result:_ These beans are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. | Hypothesis.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Result:_ These beans \\\\[oddly\\\\] are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. |\\n\\n#### _A Theory of Probable Inference_ (1883)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: A Theory of Probable Inference (1883)\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits (weighed, not counted like objects), explicitly so in his influential 1883 \"A theory of probable inference\", in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion.[\\\\[37\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Pierce-1883-37) Like \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" in 1878, it was widely read (see the historical books on statistics by [Stephen Stigler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stigler \"Stephen Stigler\")), unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction. Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances.\\n\\n[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes \"Sherlock Holmes\") used this method of reasoning in the stories of [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle \"Arthur Conan Doyle\"), although Holmes refers to it as \" [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\")\".[\\\\[38\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-38)[\\\\[39\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-39)[\\\\[40\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-40)\\n\\n#### _Minute Logic_ (1902) and after\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Minute Logic (1902) and after\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1902 Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension (i.e., objects and characters as referenced by terms), as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought.[\\\\[41\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-41) In 1903 he offered the following form for abduction:[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20)\\n\\n> The surprising fact, C, is observed;\\n>\\n> But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.\\n\\nThe hypothesis is framed, but not asserted, in a premise, then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion. Thus, as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form, the conclusion is formulated from some premise(s). But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed. Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises, but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences, or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis; either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts.\\n\\nNote that the hypothesis (\"A\") could be of a rule. It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation (\"C\"), which needs to follow only as a \"matter of course\"; or the \"course\" itself could amount to some known rule, merely alluded to, and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity. In the same year, Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts, so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely.[\\\\[35\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-newidea-35)\\n\\nPeirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the 1903 form. In 1911, he wrote, \"I do not, at present, feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all \\'Retroductions\\'. For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind.\"[\\\\[36\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-kehler-36)\\n\\n#### Pragmatism\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Pragmatism\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1901 Peirce wrote, \"There would be no logic in imposing rules, and saying that they ought to be followed, until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them.\"[\\\\[42\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-42) In 1903 Peirce called [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") \"the logic of abduction\" and said that the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general.[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) The pragmatic maxim is:\\n\\n> Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\\n\\nIt is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object\\'s conceived effects. Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction\\'s purpose in inquiry, the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct. In various writings in the 1900s[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28)[\\\\[43\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-43) he said that the conduct of abduction (or retroduction) is governed by considerations of economy, belonging in particular to the economics of research. He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic (that is, theory of inquiry).[\\\\[44\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-44)\\n\\n#### Three levels of logic about abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Three levels of logic about abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce came over the years to [divide (philosophical) logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_the_sciences_(Peirce)#Sciences \"Classification of the sciences (Peirce)\") into three departments:\\n\\n1. Stechiology, or speculative grammar, on the conditions for meaningfulness. Classification of signs (semblances, symptoms, symbols, etc.) and their combinations (as well as their objects and [interpretants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretant \"Interpretant\")).\\n2. Logical critic, or logic proper, on validity or justifiability of inference, the conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various modes (deduction, induction, abduction).\\n3. Methodeutic, or speculative rhetoric, on the conditions for determination of interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its interplay of modes.\\n\\nPeirce had, from the start, seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and, by the 1900s, held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion, one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found, predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis. That is [Peirce\\'s outline of the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#Scientific_method \"Charles Sanders Peirce\") of inquiry, as covered in his inquiry methodology, which includes [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") or, as he later called it, [pragmaticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmaticism \"Pragmaticism\"), the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice.\\n\\n##### Classification of signs\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Classification of signs\")\\\\]\\n\\nAs early as 1866,[\\\\[45\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-45) Peirce held that:\\n\\n1\\\\. Hypothesis (abductive inference) is inference through an _icon_ (also called a _likeness_).\\n\\n2\\\\. Induction is inference through an _index_ (a sign by factual connection); a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn.\\n\\n3\\\\. Deduction is inference through a _symbol_ (a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object).\\n\\nIn 1902, Peirce wrote that, in abduction: \"It is recognized that the phenomena are _like_, i.e. constitute an Icon of, a replica of a general conception, or Symbol.\"[\\\\[46\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-46)\\n\\n##### Critique of arguments\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Critique of arguments\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments (as discussed above), and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural. In 1908 Peirce described this plausibility in some detail.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) It involves not likeliness based on observations (which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis), but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo\\'s natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\" (Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role; taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all). Even a well-prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right, but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry, and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature, an affinity between the mind\\'s processes and the processes of the real, which would account for why appealingly \"natural\" guesses are the ones that oftenest (or least seldom) succeed; to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since, without \"a natural bent like nature\\'s\", people would have no hope of understanding nature. In 1910 Peirce made a three-way distinction between probability, verisimilitude, and plausibility, and defined plausibility with a normative \"ought\": \"By plausibility, I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably.\"[\\\\[47\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-47) For Peirce, plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities, or on verisimilitude, or even on testability, which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference _as_ an inference, but rather a question of the hypothesis\\'s relation to the inquiry process.\\n\\nThe phrase \"inference to the best explanation\" (not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference) is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses (such as those with the [fewest assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). However, in other senses of \"best\", such as \"standing up best to tests\", it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form, since one has not tested it yet. Still, for Peirce, any justification of an abductive inference as \"good\" is not completed upon its formation as an argument (unlike with induction and deduction) and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise (such as its testability) in advancing inquiry.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27)[\\\\[48\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-48)\\n\\n##### Methodology of inquiry\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Methodology of inquiry\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26) for testing because it offers, via its trial, to expedite and economize the [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") process itself toward new truths, first of all by being testable and also by further economies,[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28) in terms of cost, value, and relationships among guesses (hypotheses). Here, considerations such as probability, absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level, come into play. For examples:\\n\\n- Cost: A simple but low-odds guess, if low in cost to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing, to get it out of the way. If surprisingly it stands up to tests, that is worth knowing early in the inquiry, which otherwise might have stayed long on a wrong though seemingly likelier track.\\n- Value: A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctual plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [subjective likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_probability \"Subjective probability\"), though reasoned, can be treacherous.\\n- Interrelationships: Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically for their\\n  - _caution_, for which Peirce gave as an example the game of [Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions \"Twenty Questions\"),\\n  - _breadth_ of applicability to explain various phenomena, and\\n  - _incomplexity_, that of a hypothesis that seems too simple but whose trial \"may give a good \\'leave\\', as the billiard-players say\", and be instructive for the pursuit of various and conflicting hypotheses that are less simple.[\\\\[49\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ2-49)\\n\\n#### Uberty\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Uberty\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce[\\\\[50\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-50) indicated that abductive reasoning is driven by the need for \"economy in research\"—the expected fact-based productivity of hypotheses, prior to deductive and inductive processes of verification. A key concept proposed by him in this regard is \" [uberty](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uberty \"wiktionary:uberty\")\"[\\\\[51\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-51)—the expected fertility and pragmatic value of reasoning. This concept seems to be gaining support via association to the [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle \"Free energy principle\").[\\\\[52\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-52)\\n\\n### Gilbert Harman (1965)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Gilbert Harman (1965)\")\\\\]\\n\\n[Gilbert Harman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Harman \"Gilbert Harman\") was a professor of philosophy at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University \"Princeton University\").

The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the prior [web of beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_belief \"Web of belief\"), while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent. The process of updating the web of beliefs can be done by the use of abduction: once an explanation for the observation has been found, integrating it does not generate inconsistency.\\n\\nGärdenfors’ paper[\\\\[58\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-G%C3%A4rdenfors-58) contains a brief survey of the area of belief revision and its relation to updating of logical databases, and explores the relationship between belief revision and nonmonotonic logic.\\n\\nThis use of abduction is not straightforward, as adding [propositional formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_formula \"Propositional formula\") to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse. Instead, abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world \"Possible world\").

It is defined as \"The use of an unclear premise based on observations, pursuing theories to try to explain it\" (Rose et al., 2020, p.\\xa0258)[\\\\[61\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-61)[\\\\[62\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-62)\\n\\n### Anthropology\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: Anthropology\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology \"Anthropology\"), [Alfred Gell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gell \"Alfred Gell\") in his influential book _Art and Agency_ defined abduction (after Eco[\\\\[63\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-63)) as \"a case of synthetic inference \\'where we find some very curious circumstances, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt that supposition\\'\".[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) Gell criticizes existing \"anthropological\" studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering \"social relationships\", specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced, circulated, and received.[\\\\[65\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-65) Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency. That is, abduction can explain how works of art inspire a _sensus communis:_ the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\nThe question Gell asks in the book is, \"how does it initially \\'speak\\' to people?\" He answers by saying that \"No reasonable person could suppose that art-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of [semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis \"Semiosis\").\"[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) However, he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre-established existence of the _sensus communis_ that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art. Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept (Peirce likened it to guessing) means that not only can it operate outside of any pre-existing framework, but moreover, it can actually intimate the existence of a framework. As Gell reasons in his analysis, the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality. A statue of a goddess, for example, in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder; and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions (which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence). Therefore, through abduction, Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths. The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\n### Computer programming\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Computer programming\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods \"Formal methods\"), logic is used to specify and prove properties of computer programs.

I argue against the tendency in the philosophy of science literature to link abduction to the inference to the best explanation (IBE), and in particular, to claim that Peircean abduction is a conceptual predecessor to IBE. \\\\[...\\\\] In particular, I claim that Peircean abduction is an in-depth account of the process of generating explanatory hypotheses, while IBE, at least in [Peter Lipton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lipton \"Peter Lipton\")\\'s thorough treatment, is a more encompassing account of the processes both of generating and of evaluating scientific hypotheses. There is then a two-fold problem with the claim that abduction is IBE. On the one hand, it conflates abduction and induction, which are two distinct forms of logical inference, with two distinct aims, as shown by Charles S. Peirce; on the other hand it lacks a clear sense of the full scope of IBE as an account of scientific inference.\\n10. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_ref-10 \"Jump up\")**[Walton, Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_N._Walton \"Douglas N.

It is necessary to add that this brief account may be misleading in some respects, and that a closer and more detailed explication of the finer points of the three analyses could reveal important underlying philosophical differences.

Sherlock Holmes, although a fictional character, remains renowned as a great detective. However, his methodology, which was _abduction_ rather than deduction, and which is innocently used by many real detectives, is rarely described, discussed, or researched. This paper compares and contrasts the three forms of inferential reasoning, and makes a case for articulating and developing the role of abduction in the work, and training, of police officers.\\n41. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_ref-41 \"Jump up\")**In Peirce, C.

If a beverage is defined as \"drinkable through a straw,\" one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage. Inductive reasoning, or _induction_, is making an inference based on an observation, and often an observation of a sample. You can induce that the soup is tasty if you observe all of your friends happily consuming it. Abductive reasoning, or _abduction_, is making a probable conclusion from what you know. If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup on the table, you can use abduction to conclude the owner of the soup is likely returning soon.\\n\\nDo you have to figure out what time you need to leave your house for an appointment? Or are you trying to decide the best choice for lunch? Or are you baffled about why a half-eaten sandwich is on the counter? These situations call for some method of reasoning, and there are three that we use daily: [_deduction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduction), [_induction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induction), and _abduction_.\\n\\n![hot dog](https://merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/images/article/art-wap-article-main/hot-dog-2616-5d6d762c31b7b116b204cc8a3286d7c6@2x.jpg)\\n\\nIn abductive reasoning, the major premise is evident, but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion are only probable. For example, if you find a half-eaten sandwich in your home, you might use probability to reason that your teenage son made the sandwich, realized he was late for work, and abandoned it before he could finish it.\\n\\n## Deductive Reasoning\\n\\n_Deduction_ is generally defined as \"the deriving of a conclusion by reasoning.\" Its specific meaning in [logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic) is \" [inference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inference) in which the conclusion about particulars follows necessarily from general or universal [premises](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premise).\" Simply put, deduction—or the process of [deducing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduce)—is the formation of a conclusion based on generally accepted statements or facts. It occurs when you are planning out trips, for instance. Say you have a 10 o\\'clock appointment with the dentist and you know that it takes 30 minutes to drive from your house to the dentist\\'s. From those two facts, you deduce that you will have to leave your house at 9:30, at the latest, to be at the dentist\\'s on time.\\n\\nDeductive reasoning always follows necessarily from general or universal premises. If a sandwich is defined as \"two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between,\" and a hot dog is defined as \"a frankfurter; especially : a frankfurter heated and served in a long split roll\" then one must deduce that [any hot dog served in a split roll is a sandwich](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/to-chew-on-10-kinds-of-sandwiches/hot-dog).\\n\\n## Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nWhereas in deduction the truth of the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the statements or facts considered (the hot dog is served in a split roll and a split roll with a filling in the middle is a sandwich), induction is a method of reasoning involving an element of [probability](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/probability). In logic, _induction_ refers specifically to \"inference of a generalized conclusion from particular instances.\" In other words, it means forming a generalization based on what is known or observed. For example, at lunch you observe 4 of your 6 coworkers ordering the same sandwich. From your observation, you then [induce](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induce) that the sandwich is probably good—and you decide to try it yourself. Induction is at play here since your reasoning is based on an observation of a small group, as opposed to universal premises.\\n\\n## Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nThe third method of reasoning, _abduction_, is defined as \"a [syllogism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syllogism) in which the major premise is evident but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion only probable.\" Basically, it involves forming a conclusion from the information that is known. A familiar example of abduction is a detective\\'s identification of a criminal by piecing together evidence at a crime scene. In an everyday scenario, you may be puzzled by a half-eaten sandwich on the kitchen counter. Abduction will lead you to the best explanation. Your reasoning might be that your teenage son made the sandwich and then saw that he was late for work. In a rush, he put the sandwich on the counter and left.\\n\\nIf you have trouble differentiating _deduction_, _induction_, and _abduction_, thinking about their roots might help. All three words are based on Latin _ducere_, meaning \"to lead.\" The prefix _[de-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/de-)_ means \"from,\" and deduction derives _from_ generally accepted statements or facts. The prefix _[in-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-)_ means \"to\" or \"toward,\" and induction leads you _to_ a generalization. The prefix _[ab-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ab-)_ means \"away,\" and you take _away_ the best explanation in abduction.\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/ \"Merriam Webster\")\\n\\n#### [Word of the Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n#### [ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n[![Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/images/svg/audio.svg)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=e&file=ecstat01 \"Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic\")\\n\\n[See Definitions and Examples](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) »\\n\\n\\nGet Word of the Day daily email!\\n\\n## Games & Quizzes\\n\\n[See All](https://www.merriam-webster.com/games)\\n\\n[![Play Quordle: Guess all four words in a limited number of tries.

If a beverage is defined as \"drinkable through a straw,\" one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage. Inductive reasoning, or _induction_, is making an inference based on an observation, and often an observation of a sample. You can induce that the soup is tasty if you observe all of your friends happily consuming it. Abductive reasoning, or _abduction_, is making a probable conclusion from what you know. If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup on the table, you can use abduction to conclude the owner of the soup is likely returning soon.\\n\\nDo you have to figure out what time you need to leave your house for an appointment? Or are you trying to decide the best choice for lunch? Or are you baffled about why a half-eaten sandwich is on the counter? These situations call for some method of reasoning, and there are three that we use daily: [_deduction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduction), [_induction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induction), and _abduction_.\\n\\n![hot dog](https://merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/images/article/art-wap-article-main/hot-dog-2616-5d6d762c31b7b116b204cc8a3286d7c6@2x.jpg)\\n\\nIn abductive reasoning, the major premise is evident, but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion are only probable. For example, if you find a half-eaten sandwich in your home, you might use probability to reason that your teenage son made the sandwich, realized he was late for work, and abandoned it before he could finish it.\\n\\n## Deductive Reasoning\\n\\n_Deduction_ is generally defined as \"the deriving of a conclusion by reasoning.\" Its specific meaning in [logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic) is \" [inference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inference) in which the conclusion about particulars follows necessarily from general or universal [premises](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premise).\" Simply put, deduction—or the process of [deducing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduce)—is the formation of a conclusion based on generally accepted statements or facts. It occurs when you are planning out trips, for instance. Say you have a 10 o\\'clock appointment with the dentist and you know that it takes 30 minutes to drive from your house to the dentist\\'s. From those two facts, you deduce that you will have to leave your house at 9:30, at the latest, to be at the dentist\\'s on time.\\n\\nDeductive reasoning always follows necessarily from general or universal premises. If a sandwich is defined as \"two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between,\" and a hot dog is defined as \"a frankfurter; especially : a frankfurter heated and served in a long split roll\" then one must deduce that [any hot dog served in a split roll is a sandwich](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/to-chew-on-10-kinds-of-sandwiches/hot-dog).\\n\\n## Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nWhereas in deduction the truth of the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the statements or facts considered (the hot dog is served in a split roll and a split roll with a filling in the middle is a sandwich), induction is a method of reasoning involving an element of [probability](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/probability). In logic, _induction_ refers specifically to \"inference of a generalized conclusion from particular instances.\" In other words, it means forming a generalization based on what is known or observed. For example, at lunch you observe 4 of your 6 coworkers ordering the same sandwich. From your observation, you then [induce](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induce) that the sandwich is probably good—and you decide to try it yourself. Induction is at play here since your reasoning is based on an observation of a small group, as opposed to universal premises.\\n\\n## Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nThe third method of reasoning, _abduction_, is defined as \"a [syllogism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syllogism) in which the major premise is evident but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion only probable.\" Basically, it involves forming a conclusion from the information that is known. A familiar example of abduction is a detective\\'s identification of a criminal by piecing together evidence at a crime scene. In an everyday scenario, you may be puzzled by a half-eaten sandwich on the kitchen counter. Abduction will lead you to the best explanation. Your reasoning might be that your teenage son made the sandwich and then saw that he was late for work. In a rush, he put the sandwich on the counter and left.\\n\\nIf you have trouble differentiating _deduction_, _induction_, and _abduction_, thinking about their roots might help. All three words are based on Latin _ducere_, meaning \"to lead.\" The prefix _[de-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/de-)_ means \"from,\" and deduction derives _from_ generally accepted statements or facts. The prefix _[in-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-)_ means \"to\" or \"toward,\" and induction leads you _to_ a generalization. The prefix _[ab-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ab-)_ means \"away,\" and you take _away_ the best explanation in abduction.\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/ \"Merriam Webster\")\\n\\n#### [Word of the Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n#### [ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n[![Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/images/svg/audio.svg)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=e&file=ecstat01 \"Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic\")\\n\\n[See Definitions and Examples](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) »\\n\\n\\nGet Word of the Day daily email!\\n\\n## Games & Quizzes\\n\\n[See All](https://www.merriam-webster.com/games)\\n\\n[![Play Quordle: Guess all four words in a limited number of tries.

You can induce that the soup is tasty if you observe all of your friends happily consuming it. Abductive reasoning, or abduction, is making a probable conclusion from what you know.

Three methods of reasoning are the deductive, inductive, and abductive approaches.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning: conclusion guaranteed**\\n\\nDeductive reasoning starts with the assertion of a general rule and proceeds from there to a guaranteed specific conclusion. Deductive reasoning moves from the general rule to the specific application: In deductive reasoning, if the original assertions are true, then the conclusion must also be true. For example, math is deductive:\\n\\n_If x = 4_\\n\\n_And if y = 1_\\n\\n_Then 2x + y = 9_\\n\\nIn this example, it is a _logical necessity_ that 2x + y equals 9; 2x + y _must_ equal 9. As a matter of fact, formal, symbolic logic uses a language that looks rather like the math equality above, complete with its own operators and syntax. But a deductive _syllogism_ (think of it as a plain-English version of a math equality) can be expressed in ordinary language:\\n\\n_If entropy (disorder) in a system will increase unless energy is expended,_\\n\\n_And if my living room is a system,_\\n\\n_Then disorder will increase in my living room unless I clean it._\\n\\nIn the syllogism above, the first two statements, the _propositions_ or _premises_, lead logically to the third statement, the _conclusion_. Here is another example:\\n\\n_A medical technology ought to be funded if it has been used successfully to treat patients._\\n\\n_Adult stem cells are being used to treat patients successfully in more than sixty-five new therapies._\\n\\n_Adult stem cell research and technology should be funded._\\n\\nA conclusion is _sound_ (true) or _unsound_ (false), depending on the truth of the original premises (for any premise may be true or false). At the same time, independent of the truth or falsity of the premises, the _deductive inference_ itself (the process of \"connecting the dots\" from premise to conclusion) is either _valid_ or _invalid_. The inferential _process_ can be valid even if the premise is false:\\n\\n_There is no such thing as drought in the West._\\n\\n_California is in the West._\\n\\n_California need never make plans to deal with a drought._\\n\\nIn the example above, though the inferential process itself is valid, the conclusion is false because the premise, _There is no such thing as drought in the West_, is false. A syllogism yields a false conclusion if either of its propositions is false. A syllogism like this is particularly insidious because it looks so very logical–it is, in fact, logical. But whether in error or malice, if either of the propositions above is wrong, then a policy decision based upon it ( _California need never make plans to deal with a drought_) probably would fail to serve the public interest.\\n\\nAssuming the propositions are sound, the rather stern logic of deductive reasoning can give you absolutely certain conclusions. However, deductive reasoning cannot really increase human knowledge (it is _nonampliative_) because the conclusions yielded by deductive reasoning are _tautologies_-statements that are contained within the premises and virtually self-evident. Therefore, while with deductive reasoning we can make observations and expand implications, we cannot make predictions about future or otherwise non-observed phenomena.\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning: conclusion merely likely** Inductive reasoning begins with observations that are specific and limited in scope, and proceeds to a generalized conclusion that is likely, but not certain, in light of accumulated evidence. You could say that inductive reasoning moves from the specific to the general. Much scientific research is carried out by the inductive method: gathering evidence, seeking patterns, and forming a hypothesis or theory to explain what is seen.\\n\\nConclusions reached by the inductive method are not logical necessities; no amount of inductive evidence guarantees the conclusion. This is because there is no way to know that all the possible evidence has been gathered, and that there exists no further bit of unobserved evidence that might invalidate my hypothesis. Thus, while the newspapers might report the conclusions of scientific research as absolutes, scientific literature itself uses more cautious language, the language of inductively reached, probable conclusions:\\n\\n_What we have seen is the ability of these cells to feed the blood vessels of tumors and to heal the blood vessels surrounding wounds. The findings suggest that these adult stem cells may be an ideal source of cells for clinical therapy. For example, we can envision the use of these stem cells for therapies against cancer tumors \\\\[...\\\\].1_\\n\\nBecause inductive conclusions are not logical necessities, inductive arguments are not simply true. Rather, they are cogent: that is, the evidence seems complete, relevant, and generally convincing, and the conclusion is therefore probably true. Nor are inductive arguments simply false; rather, they are _not cogent_.\\n\\nIt is an important difference from deductive reasoning that, while inductive reasoning cannot yield an absolutely certain conclusion, it can actually increase human knowledge (it is _ampliative_). It can make predictions about future events or as-yet unobserved phenomena.\\n\\nFor example, Albert Einstein observed the movement of a pocket compass when he was five years old and became fascinated with the idea that something invisible in the space around the compass needle was causing it to move. This observation, combined with additional observations (of moving trains, for example) and the results of logical and mathematical tools (deduction), resulted in a rule that fit his observations and could predict events that were as yet unobserved.\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning: taking your best shot** Abductive reasoning typically begins with an incomplete set of observations and proceeds to the likeliest possible explanation for the set. Abductive reasoning yields the kind of daily decision-making that does its best with the information at hand, which often is incomplete.\\n\\nA medical diagnosis is an application of abductive reasoning: given this set of symptoms, what is the diagnosis that would best explain most of them? Likewise, when jurors hear evidence in a criminal case, they must consider whether the prosecution or the defense has the best explanation to cover all the points of evidence. While there may be no certainty about their verdict, since there may exist additional evidence that was not admitted in the case, they make their best guess based on what they know.\\n\\nWhile cogent inductive reasoning requires that the evidence that might shed light on the subject be fairly complete, whether positive or negative, abductive reasoning is characterized by lack of completeness, either in the evidence, or in the explanation, or both. A patient may be unconscious or fail to report every symptom, for example, resulting in incomplete evidence, or a doctor may arrive at a diagnosis that fails to explain several of the symptoms. Still, he must reach the best diagnosis he can.\\n\\nThe abductive process can be creative, intuitive, even revolutionary.2 Einstein\\'s work, for example, was not just inductive and deductive, but involved a creative leap of imagination and visualization that scarcely seemed warranted by the mere observation of moving trains and falling elevators. In fact, so much of Einstein\\'s work was done as a \"thought experiment\" (for he never experimentally dropped elevators), that some of his peers discredited it as too fanciful. Nevertheless, he appears to have been right-until now his remarkable conclusions about space-time continue to be verified experientially.\\n\\n_References_\\n\\n_1\\\\.

It can make predictions about future events or as-yet unobserved phenomena.\\n\\nFor example, Albert Einstein observed the movement of a pocket compass when he was five years old and became fascinated with the idea that something invisible in the space around the compass needle was causing it to move. This observation, combined with additional observations (of moving trains, for example) and the results of logical and mathematical tools (deduction), resulted in a rule that fit his observations and could predict events that were as yet unobserved.\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning: taking your best shot** Abductive reasoning typically begins with an incomplete set of observations and proceeds to the likeliest possible explanation for the set. Abductive reasoning yields the kind of daily decision-making that does its best with the information at hand, which often is incomplete.\\n\\nA medical diagnosis is an application of abductive reasoning: given this set of symptoms, what is the diagnosis that would best explain most of them? Likewise, when jurors hear evidence in a criminal case, they must consider whether the prosecution or the defense has the best explanation to cover all the points of evidence. While there may be no certainty about their verdict, since there may exist additional evidence that was not admitted in the case, they make their best guess based on what they know.\\n\\nWhile cogent inductive reasoning requires that the evidence that might shed light on the subject be fairly complete, whether positive or negative, abductive reasoning is characterized by lack of completeness, either in the evidence, or in the explanation, or both. A patient may be unconscious or fail to report every symptom, for example, resulting in incomplete evidence, or a doctor may arrive at a diagnosis that fails to explain several of the symptoms. Still, he must reach the best diagnosis he can.\\n\\nThe abductive process can be creative, intuitive, even revolutionary.2 Einstein\\'s work, for example, was not just inductive and deductive, but involved a creative leap of imagination and visualization that scarcely seemed warranted by the mere observation of moving trains and falling elevators. In fact, so much of Einstein\\'s work was done as a \"thought experiment\" (for he never experimentally dropped elevators), that some of his peers discredited it as too fanciful. Nevertheless, he appears to have been right-until now his remarkable conclusions about space-time continue to be verified experientially.\\n\\n_References_\\n\\n_1\\\\.

IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\nThe Basic IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\n## The Basic Idea\\n\\nThe scientific method begins with a hypothesis—an educated guess. After making some sort of observation about the world, scientists come up with a potential explanation, which they put to the test using cleverly-designed experiments. But until there’s data to back them up, hypotheses are just stabs in the dark: they might be accurate, but they also might not be.\\n\\nThe generation of hypotheses relies on a particular kind of logical inference, known as\\xa0**abductive reasoning**, abduction, “inference to the best explanation,” or, simply, “hypothesis.” Alongside its sisters, deductive (“top-down”) reasoning and inductive (“bottom-up”) reasoning, abductive reasoning is a core component of the methodology of science, and although it cannot itself be the basis for any sort of conclusions about the world, it represents the crucial first step towards that end.\\n\\n“\\n\\n> **_Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.._**\\n>\\n> **\\\\- Charles Peirce1**\\n\\n## History\\n\\nAbductive reasoning was coined by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce around 1865.1,2\\xa0Up until this point, philosophers had divided logical arguments into two subclasses. First, you have deduction, or “necessary inference,” where a specific conclusion follows from a general rule. For example, given the premises “All men are mortal” and\\xa0 “Socrates is a man,” deductive reasoning leads us to the conclusion that Socrates must be mortal. Deduction results in “necessary” inferences because it is always correct: it’s about taking rules that apply to a wider population and inferring that they also apply to a random sample.2\\n\\nIn contrast, induction is a type of “probable” inference, extrapolating a general rule based on specific examples. For instance, given the premises “Socrates is a man” and “Socrates is mortal,” induction leads us to the generalized conclusion that “All men are mortal.” This process is the inverse of deduction, making an argument about a population based on a smaller sample, which can often lead to incorrect conclusions.\\n\\nDeduction and induction capture many of the logical arguments that a person can make, but Charles Sanders Peirce noticed that there was a type of argument that didn’t fit into either of these categories. Imagine, for example, that you go out for a walk, and you notice that the grass is wet. As a first premise, you know that when it rains, the grass gets wet; and as a second premise, you know that the grass is currently wet. You might be tempted to argue that, therefore, it must have rained. There’s a strong possibility that this is the case—but it’s also not the only possible explanation for the grass being wet. This could also be because, say, somebody had their sprinkler on earlier. You’ve made an educated guess, but it is not the sole conclusion to be drawn. This “best guess” reasoning is what Peirce called\\xa0_abduction_.2\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the most important function of abduction is\\xa0 as a component of the scientific method. Peirce, as a scientist himself, integrated the three forms of logical argument—deduction, induction, and now abduction—into one comprehensive methodology for seeking the truth: the scientific method.2 After _abducting_ a hypothesis, probably after making some sort of surprising observation, scientists use deduction to help them figure out how to test their theory, coming up with one or more necessary inferences that would have to prove true if the hypothesis were correct. Finally, researchers engage in induction, running an experiment and making a probable inference in order to explain its results.2\\n\\n## Controversies\\n\\nWhen Peirce introduced the concept of abduction, he envisioned it, alongside deduction and induction, as forming a logical trichotomy—a distinct, three-phase approach to a better understanding of reality. He thought of these processes as the basic building blocks of reason, each being irreducible to another. In other words, he thought of them as totally distinct logical operations. However, not all philosophers agree that abduction is its own, unique type of logical reasoning. Instead, some have argued that abductive arguments can actually be broken down into deductive and [inductive reasoning](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/inductive-reasoning).3\\n\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27180%27%20height=%27180%27/%3e)![](https://thedecisionlab.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.prismic.io%2Fthedecisionlab%2FZv45b7VsGrYSwUtA_ZpC9CR5LeNNTxFSY_Group657323571.webp%3Fauto%3Dformat%2Ccompress&w=384&q=75)\\n\\n### behavior change 101\\n\\n# Start your behavior change journey at the right place\\n\\n[What is behavior change? ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/what-is-behavior-change) [Learn the tools of the trade ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/tools-of-the-trade) [Frameworks for lasting change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-frameworks) [Behavior change in action ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-in-action) [Making a career of beh change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/making-a-career-of-behavior-change) [See real world examples ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/) [Advanced concepts & trends ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/)\\n\\n## Related TDL content\\n\\n[**TDL Perspectives: Becoming an Applied Behavioral Scientist**](https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/education/tdl-perspectives-becoming-a-behavioral-scientist)\\n\\nApplied behavioral science is all about using the scientific method—abduction, deduction, induction—to find evidence-based solutions to the problems plaguing some kind of system.

IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\nThe Basic IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\n## The Basic Idea\\n\\nThe scientific method begins with a hypothesis—an educated guess. After making some sort of observation about the world, scientists come up with a potential explanation, which they put to the test using cleverly-designed experiments. But until there’s data to back them up, hypotheses are just stabs in the dark: they might be accurate, but they also might not be.\\n\\nThe generation of hypotheses relies on a particular kind of logical inference, known as\\xa0**abductive reasoning**, abduction, “inference to the best explanation,” or, simply, “hypothesis.” Alongside its sisters, deductive (“top-down”) reasoning and inductive (“bottom-up”) reasoning, abductive reasoning is a core component of the methodology of science, and although it cannot itself be the basis for any sort of conclusions about the world, it represents the crucial first step towards that end.\\n\\n“\\n\\n> **_Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.._**\\n>\\n> **\\\\- Charles Peirce1**\\n\\n## History\\n\\nAbductive reasoning was coined by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce around 1865.1,2\\xa0Up until this point, philosophers had divided logical arguments into two subclasses. First, you have deduction, or “necessary inference,” where a specific conclusion follows from a general rule. For example, given the premises “All men are mortal” and\\xa0 “Socrates is a man,” deductive reasoning leads us to the conclusion that Socrates must be mortal. Deduction results in “necessary” inferences because it is always correct: it’s about taking rules that apply to a wider population and inferring that they also apply to a random sample.2\\n\\nIn contrast, induction is a type of “probable” inference, extrapolating a general rule based on specific examples. For instance, given the premises “Socrates is a man” and “Socrates is mortal,” induction leads us to the generalized conclusion that “All men are mortal.” This process is the inverse of deduction, making an argument about a population based on a smaller sample, which can often lead to incorrect conclusions.\\n\\nDeduction and induction capture many of the logical arguments that a person can make, but Charles Sanders Peirce noticed that there was a type of argument that didn’t fit into either of these categories. Imagine, for example, that you go out for a walk, and you notice that the grass is wet. As a first premise, you know that when it rains, the grass gets wet; and as a second premise, you know that the grass is currently wet. You might be tempted to argue that, therefore, it must have rained. There’s a strong possibility that this is the case—but it’s also not the only possible explanation for the grass being wet. This could also be because, say, somebody had their sprinkler on earlier. You’ve made an educated guess, but it is not the sole conclusion to be drawn. This “best guess” reasoning is what Peirce called\\xa0_abduction_.2\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the most important function of abduction is\\xa0 as a component of the scientific method. Peirce, as a scientist himself, integrated the three forms of logical argument—deduction, induction, and now abduction—into one comprehensive methodology for seeking the truth: the scientific method.2 After _abducting_ a hypothesis, probably after making some sort of surprising observation, scientists use deduction to help them figure out how to test their theory, coming up with one or more necessary inferences that would have to prove true if the hypothesis were correct. Finally, researchers engage in induction, running an experiment and making a probable inference in order to explain its results.2\\n\\n## Controversies\\n\\nWhen Peirce introduced the concept of abduction, he envisioned it, alongside deduction and induction, as forming a logical trichotomy—a distinct, three-phase approach to a better understanding of reality. He thought of these processes as the basic building blocks of reason, each being irreducible to another. In other words, he thought of them as totally distinct logical operations. However, not all philosophers agree that abduction is its own, unique type of logical reasoning. Instead, some have argued that abductive arguments can actually be broken down into deductive and [inductive reasoning](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/inductive-reasoning).3\\n\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27180%27%20height=%27180%27/%3e)![](https://thedecisionlab.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.prismic.io%2Fthedecisionlab%2FZv45b7VsGrYSwUtA_ZpC9CR5LeNNTxFSY_Group657323571.webp%3Fauto%3Dformat%2Ccompress&w=384&q=75)\\n\\n### behavior change 101\\n\\n# Start your behavior change journey at the right place\\n\\n[What is behavior change? ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/what-is-behavior-change) [Learn the tools of the trade ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/tools-of-the-trade) [Frameworks for lasting change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-frameworks) [Behavior change in action ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-in-action) [Making a career of beh change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/making-a-career-of-behavior-change) [See real world examples ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/) [Advanced concepts & trends ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/)\\n\\n## Related TDL content\\n\\n[**TDL Perspectives: Becoming an Applied Behavioral Scientist**](https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/education/tdl-perspectives-becoming-a-behavioral-scientist)\\n\\nApplied behavioral science is all about using the scientific method—abduction, deduction, induction—to find evidence-based solutions to the problems plaguing some kind of system.

reasoning?\\n\\nAbductive reasoning refers to the thought process involved in a judgment about what explanation underlies a group of facts or observations. It can also be called inference to the best explanation because the goal of abductive reasoning is to ascertain which of the explanations under consideration is the best or most plausible.\\n\\n#### What is abductive reasoning used for?\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is used for many different things. It can be used in every situation in which someone seeks to explain evidence of any kind. Therefore, the uses of abductive reasoning include many situations throughout daily life, as well as in science and other fields.\\n\\n#### What is an abductive reasoning example?\\n\\nAn example of abductive reasoning would be if someone heard birdsong outside their window and concluded that a bird was probably nearby. There are other potential explanations, such as the possibility that a person is playing audio of birdsong from a speaker, but the explanation that there is a bird outside seems more reasonable, and is more likely to be true in most situations. The process of determining which of these potential explanations makes more sense is abductive reasoning.\\n\\n[Create an account](https://study.com/academy/plans.html)\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [What Is Abductive Reasoning?](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---WhatIsAbductiveReasoning)\\n- [Abductive Reasoning Examples](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---AbductiveReasoningExamples)\\n- [Abductive Reasoning vs Deductive Reasoning](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---AbductiveReasoningVsDeductiveReasoning)\\n- [Abductive Reasoning vs Inductive Reasoning](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---AbductiveReasoningVsInductiveReasoning)\\n- [Lesson Summary](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---LessonSummary)\\n\\nShow\\n\\n**What Is Abductive Reasoning?**\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning**, or abduction, is a type of reasoning that occurs when a person observes particular evidence and determines what explanation accounts for those facts in the best way. Given some observations of the world that a person wants to explain, they come up with hypotheses, or potential explanations of why the observed facts are the way that they are. Abduction allows a person to conclude that one of those hypotheses is true, or likely true, because it makes more sense than the others, based on various possible criteria; for example, a hypothesis might seem simpler, or could seem more plausible given background knowledge that a person has. The conclusion of an abductive argument is therefore a logical assumption.\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is a form of inference, which involves concluding that a certain claim is true based on one\\'s knowledge of other claims. Abductive reasoning can therefore also be called abductive inference. It can also be called abductive logic because it involves using reason or logic to reach conclusions. Another term for abductive reasoning is abductive argument because abduction involves an argument that some conclusion is true. Abductive reasoning is also known as \\'\\'Inference to the Best Explanation.\\'\\'\\n\\nAbductive reasoning can be compared to another type of inference called **deductive reasoning**. A key difference between the two is that if a deductive argument is structured properly and is made up of true claims or premises, then its conclusion has to be true based on the laws of logic. In an abductive argument, on the other hand, the conclusion is considered to be true or likely true, but it does not have to be; it is possible that the best explanation is still false. In other words, the conclusion of a deductive argument is meant to be a certainty, whereas the conclusion of an abductive argument is only a best guess. The differences between abduction and deduction are explained in more detail later in the lesson.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n![](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/carrrhfke6.jpg)\\n\\n![Video Thumbnail](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html)\\n\\nClick for sound\\n\\n3:48\\n\\n## You must cCreate an account to continue\\xa0watching\\n\\n### Register to view this lesson\\n\\nAre you a student or a teacher?\\n\\nI am a student\\nI am a teacher\\n\\n\\nCreate Your Account To Continue Watching\\n\\nAs a member, you\\'ll also get unlimited access to over 88,000\\nlessons in math, English, science, history, and more.

The following are abductive argument examples.\\n\\nSuppose that a person looks out their window and sees snow on the ground. There are different possible explanations for this evidence. One is that snow fell overnight and covered the ground. Another is that someone used a snow machine to cover the person\\'s lawn with snow. The person who looks outside and sees snow would almost certainly conclude that the first explanation is much better than the second, and therefore infer that snow fell last night. They might use this inference to conclude that they should wear boots on their walk to work, as they would not need to do so if the snow was just placed on their lawn and nowhere else. This is a case of abduction because the person takes observed evidence and figures out which explanation makes the most sense. In such a case, the person probably does not even know that they are using a reasoning process of any kind; they automatically jump to the hypothesis that seems most reasonable.\\n\\nAs another example, suppose that someone is at work in the middle of the day and has a question for a coworker, but then they see their coworker leave the building. They might construct several hypotheses as to why the coworker left. Perhaps they are going out for lunch. Perhaps they are leaving for the day because they have an appointment. Perhaps they are quitting their job. Each of these hypotheses would explain why they saw the coworker leave. However, the person might conclude that the best explanation is that the coworker went out for lunch, because they often go out for lunch and they rarely have appointments, and they like their job so they are probably not quitting. In this way, the person could use abduction to conclude that their coworker is probably going out for lunch. This might cause them to conclude that they should wait until the coworker gets back to ask the question.\\n\\nMany scholars also think that scientific reasoning frequently involves abduction. For instance, a famous case of abduction in science involves the discovery of the planet Neptune. Neptune was hypothesized to exist in order to explain why Uranus had such a strange orbit; the presence of Neptune would explain this because it pulls on Uranus and changes its path. This is a case of abduction because, given the evidence of Uranus\\'s orbit, there were multiple explanations; for example, it could also have been true that Uranus had a strange orbit because the laws of gravity were misunderstood. However, that would be an extreme conclusion, so Neptune\\'s existence seemed like a better explanation, and of course turned out to be true.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![Abductive reasoning led to the hypothesis that an eighth planet, Neptune, was changing the orbit of Uranus.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/neptune_full481453428272912254.jpg) |\\n\\nThe discovery of Neptune is an example of the importance of abductive reasoning to science.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Deductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning,** or deduction, is a type of inference that differs in important ways from abductive reasoning. The central distinction has to do with the structure of a deductive argument. In general, an argument is structured such that the premises lead to the conclusion; premises are simply the claims the argument makes before the final claim, which is the conclusion. If the argument succeeds, it is because the premises are correct and, therefore, the conclusion is also correct. In a deductive argument, the premises make the conclusion logically necessary; that is, the laws of logic ensure that the conclusion is true whenever the premises are. An abductive argument, on the other hand, does not have a conclusion that is logically necessary.\\n\\nAn [example of a deductive argument](https://study.com/learn/lesson/deductive-argument-examples.html) is the following series of claims:\\n\\n- Premise: All galaxies are made of stars.\\n- Premise: The Andromeda Galaxy is a galaxy.\\n- Conclusion: The Andromeda Galaxy is made of stars.\\n\\nThe two premises seem clearly true, based on the definitions of \\'\\'galaxy\\'\\' and \\'\\'Andromeda Galaxy.\\'\\' In that case, the laws of logic make it certain that the conclusion is true as well; it would violate logic if all galaxies had stars, but the Andromeda Galaxy did not have stars.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![One might use deductive reasoning to prove that the Andromeda Galaxy contains stars.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/andromeda_galaxy_26579046521695553672.jpg) |\\n\\nThe argument that all galaxies have stars, and therefore the Andromeda Galaxy must have stars, is an example of deductive reasoning.\\n\\nThe same logical necessity does not apply to an abductive argument. If someone sees snow on the ground outside and concludes that it was snowing last night, it will not violate logic for them to be wrong; it would simply be a strange situation in which some other cause had put snow on their yard.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Inductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning,** or induction, is another type of reasoning that, like abductive reasoning, comes to conclusions that are reasonable inferences but not logically necessary; in this way, deductive and inductive reasoning are opposites. The difference between inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning is that while abduction involves figuring out explanations, induction only involves making predictions or claims. An example of an inductive argument would be the following:\\n\\n- Premise: Most books I have read contain chapters.\\n- Conclusion: This particular book, which I have not read, likely contains chapters.\\n\\nThis is a case of induction rather than abduction because there is no underlying explanation proposed for why books generally contain chapters; the premise is simply used to make a prediction about another book. It is not a case of deduction because the conclusion is fairly strong, but it is not logically necessary: some books don\\'t have chapters, so it is perfectly possible that the unread book does not have chapters.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n**Lesson Summary**\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning**, also known as inference to the best explanation, is a method of reasoning that involves inferring which of several explanations for particular observed facts is the most compelling one. An abductive argument is used to make a logical assumption or a best guess, so its conclusion might be false. Abductive reasoning is important in everyday life, as people constantly try to account for their observations of the world; it is also important in scientific study. An example of an abductive argument would be the claim that some particular cause is probably responsible for the things that someone has observed. Abductive reasoning can be distinguished from two other types of inference: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. An argument that employs **deductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is necessarily true if the argument succeeds. An example of a deductive argument would be the claim that since a particular object falls within a given category, and every object in that category has a certain trait, this particular object must have the trait as well. An argument that employs **inductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is not necessarily true but is simply likely or well-supported; unlike abductive reasoning, however, inductive reasoning does not involve explanations. An example of an inductive argument would be the claim that since most or all of the objects a person has observed within a given category have some feature, other objects they have not observed in that category must have the feature as well.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n## Video Transcript\\n\\n## What Is Abductive Reasoning?\\n\\nYou have a cough, a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a runny nose, chills, an aching body, nausea and diarrhea. You have had these symptoms for five days. Given this information, your best guess is that you have influenza, or the flu. But you are not completely certain. This is an example of abductive reasoning.\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is to abduce (or take away) a logical assumption, explanation, inference, conclusion, hypothesis, or best guess from an observation or set of observations. Because the conclusion is merely a best guess, the conclusion that is drawn may or may not be true. Let\\'s look at some examples to gain a better understanding of this reasoning process.\\n\\n## Examples of Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nJury duty decisions are one example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re a juror and the defendant looks like the image of the man on the security camera robbing the bank. He stutters and pauses, like he is guilty, when answering questions posed by the prosecutor. You conclude, as a juror on your first day as a member of the jury, that he is guilty, but you are not certain. Here, you have made a decision based on your observations, but you are not certain it is the right decision.\\n\\nDaily decision-making is also an example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re stuck in traffic on the interstate and see ambulance and police lights about a half mile ahead. There is an exit coming up and you could take some backroads and then get back on the interstate after the accident. You listen to the traffic report on the radio. You look and see if the exit looks congested. Taking all the information at hand, you make the decision to stay on the interstate and wait for the accident to clear. You made the best decision you could given all of the observations.\\n\\n## Deductive & Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nSo, abductive reasoning is really taking an incomplete or partial list of observations about a situation and drawing an inference from these observations. It is an informal process. We use it in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. This reasoning moves from the general to the specific. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. Here is an example:\\n\\nIt is a general rule that all reptiles have scales. If an iguana is a reptile, what specific conclusion can you draw from the above general rule? Your specific conclusion would be that iguanas have scales.\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning** moves from the specific to the general, which is the opposite of deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning, which gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true. Here is an example where the general conclusion that is drawn is most likely incorrect:\\n\\nYour specific observation is that a baby didn\\'t like peaches or apples. Your general conclusion is that the baby won\\'t like any type of fruit.\\n\\n## Lesson Summary\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is a logical assumption formed by observations and which is turned into a hypothesis. In abductive reasoning, the conclusion that is drawn is merely an educated guess or hypothesis and is, therefore, not absolutely verifiable or true. We use a lot of abductive reasoning in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. **Inductive reasoning**, however, moves from the specific to the general and is the opposite of deductive reasoning. It is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning that gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true.\\n\\n### Register to view this lesson\\n\\nAre you a student or a teacher?\\n\\nI am a student\\nI am a teacher\\n\\n\\n### Unlock Your Education\\n\\n#### See for yourself why 30 million people use Study.com\\n\\n##### Become a Study.com member and start learning now.\\n\\n[Become a Member](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\nAlready a member?

reasoning?\\n\\nAbductive reasoning refers to the thought process involved in a judgment about what explanation underlies a group of facts or observations. It can also be called inference to the best explanation because the goal of abductive reasoning is to ascertain which of the explanations under consideration is the best or most plausible.\\n\\n#### What is abductive reasoning used for?\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is used for many different things. It can be used in every situation in which someone seeks to explain evidence of any kind. Therefore, the uses of abductive reasoning include many situations throughout daily life, as well as in science and other fields.\\n\\n#### What is an abductive reasoning example?\\n\\nAn example of abductive reasoning would be if someone heard birdsong outside their window and concluded that a bird was probably nearby. There are other potential explanations, such as the possibility that a person is playing audio of birdsong from a speaker, but the explanation that there is a bird outside seems more reasonable, and is more likely to be true in most situations. The process of determining which of these potential explanations makes more sense is abductive reasoning.\\n\\n[Create an account](https://study.com/academy/plans.html)\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [What Is Abductive Reasoning?](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---WhatIsAbductiveReasoning)\\n- [Abductive Reasoning Examples](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---AbductiveReasoningExamples)\\n- [Abductive Reasoning vs Deductive Reasoning](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---AbductiveReasoningVsDeductiveReasoning)\\n- [Abductive Reasoning vs Inductive Reasoning](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---AbductiveReasoningVsInductiveReasoning)\\n- [Lesson Summary](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#section---LessonSummary)\\n\\nShow\\n\\n**What Is Abductive Reasoning?**\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning**, or abduction, is a type of reasoning that occurs when a person observes particular evidence and determines what explanation accounts for those facts in the best way. Given some observations of the world that a person wants to explain, they come up with hypotheses, or potential explanations of why the observed facts are the way that they are. Abduction allows a person to conclude that one of those hypotheses is true, or likely true, because it makes more sense than the others, based on various possible criteria; for example, a hypothesis might seem simpler, or could seem more plausible given background knowledge that a person has. The conclusion of an abductive argument is therefore a logical assumption.\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is a form of inference, which involves concluding that a certain claim is true based on one\\'s knowledge of other claims. Abductive reasoning can therefore also be called abductive inference. It can also be called abductive logic because it involves using reason or logic to reach conclusions. Another term for abductive reasoning is abductive argument because abduction involves an argument that some conclusion is true. Abductive reasoning is also known as \\'\\'Inference to the Best Explanation.\\'\\'\\n\\nAbductive reasoning can be compared to another type of inference called **deductive reasoning**. A key difference between the two is that if a deductive argument is structured properly and is made up of true claims or premises, then its conclusion has to be true based on the laws of logic. In an abductive argument, on the other hand, the conclusion is considered to be true or likely true, but it does not have to be; it is possible that the best explanation is still false. In other words, the conclusion of a deductive argument is meant to be a certainty, whereas the conclusion of an abductive argument is only a best guess. The differences between abduction and deduction are explained in more detail later in the lesson.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n![](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/carrrhfke6.jpg)\\n\\n![Video Thumbnail](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html)\\n\\nClick for sound\\n\\n3:48\\n\\n## You must cCreate an account to continue\\xa0watching\\n\\n### Register to view this lesson\\n\\nAre you a student or a teacher?\\n\\nI am a student\\nI am a teacher\\n\\n\\nCreate Your Account To Continue Watching\\n\\nAs a member, you\\'ll also get unlimited access to over 88,000\\nlessons in math, English, science, history, and more.

The following are abductive argument examples.\\n\\nSuppose that a person looks out their window and sees snow on the ground. There are different possible explanations for this evidence. One is that snow fell overnight and covered the ground. Another is that someone used a snow machine to cover the person\\'s lawn with snow. The person who looks outside and sees snow would almost certainly conclude that the first explanation is much better than the second, and therefore infer that snow fell last night. They might use this inference to conclude that they should wear boots on their walk to work, as they would not need to do so if the snow was just placed on their lawn and nowhere else. This is a case of abduction because the person takes observed evidence and figures out which explanation makes the most sense. In such a case, the person probably does not even know that they are using a reasoning process of any kind; they automatically jump to the hypothesis that seems most reasonable.\\n\\nAs another example, suppose that someone is at work in the middle of the day and has a question for a coworker, but then they see their coworker leave the building. They might construct several hypotheses as to why the coworker left. Perhaps they are going out for lunch. Perhaps they are leaving for the day because they have an appointment. Perhaps they are quitting their job. Each of these hypotheses would explain why they saw the coworker leave. However, the person might conclude that the best explanation is that the coworker went out for lunch, because they often go out for lunch and they rarely have appointments, and they like their job so they are probably not quitting. In this way, the person could use abduction to conclude that their coworker is probably going out for lunch. This might cause them to conclude that they should wait until the coworker gets back to ask the question.\\n\\nMany scholars also think that scientific reasoning frequently involves abduction. For instance, a famous case of abduction in science involves the discovery of the planet Neptune. Neptune was hypothesized to exist in order to explain why Uranus had such a strange orbit; the presence of Neptune would explain this because it pulls on Uranus and changes its path. This is a case of abduction because, given the evidence of Uranus\\'s orbit, there were multiple explanations; for example, it could also have been true that Uranus had a strange orbit because the laws of gravity were misunderstood. However, that would be an extreme conclusion, so Neptune\\'s existence seemed like a better explanation, and of course turned out to be true.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![Abductive reasoning led to the hypothesis that an eighth planet, Neptune, was changing the orbit of Uranus.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/neptune_full481453428272912254.jpg) |\\n\\nThe discovery of Neptune is an example of the importance of abductive reasoning to science.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Deductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning,** or deduction, is a type of inference that differs in important ways from abductive reasoning. The central distinction has to do with the structure of a deductive argument. In general, an argument is structured such that the premises lead to the conclusion; premises are simply the claims the argument makes before the final claim, which is the conclusion. If the argument succeeds, it is because the premises are correct and, therefore, the conclusion is also correct. In a deductive argument, the premises make the conclusion logically necessary; that is, the laws of logic ensure that the conclusion is true whenever the premises are. An abductive argument, on the other hand, does not have a conclusion that is logically necessary.\\n\\nAn [example of a deductive argument](https://study.com/learn/lesson/deductive-argument-examples.html) is the following series of claims:\\n\\n- Premise: All galaxies are made of stars.\\n- Premise: The Andromeda Galaxy is a galaxy.\\n- Conclusion: The Andromeda Galaxy is made of stars.\\n\\nThe two premises seem clearly true, based on the definitions of \\'\\'galaxy\\'\\' and \\'\\'Andromeda Galaxy.\\'\\' In that case, the laws of logic make it certain that the conclusion is true as well; it would violate logic if all galaxies had stars, but the Andromeda Galaxy did not have stars.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![One might use deductive reasoning to prove that the Andromeda Galaxy contains stars.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/andromeda_galaxy_26579046521695553672.jpg) |\\n\\nThe argument that all galaxies have stars, and therefore the Andromeda Galaxy must have stars, is an example of deductive reasoning.\\n\\nThe same logical necessity does not apply to an abductive argument. If someone sees snow on the ground outside and concludes that it was snowing last night, it will not violate logic for them to be wrong; it would simply be a strange situation in which some other cause had put snow on their yard.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Inductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning,** or induction, is another type of reasoning that, like abductive reasoning, comes to conclusions that are reasonable inferences but not logically necessary; in this way, deductive and inductive reasoning are opposites. The difference between inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning is that while abduction involves figuring out explanations, induction only involves making predictions or claims. An example of an inductive argument would be the following:\\n\\n- Premise: Most books I have read contain chapters.\\n- Conclusion: This particular book, which I have not read, likely contains chapters.\\n\\nThis is a case of induction rather than abduction because there is no underlying explanation proposed for why books generally contain chapters; the premise is simply used to make a prediction about another book. It is not a case of deduction because the conclusion is fairly strong, but it is not logically necessary: some books don\\'t have chapters, so it is perfectly possible that the unread book does not have chapters.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n**Lesson Summary**\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning**, also known as inference to the best explanation, is a method of reasoning that involves inferring which of several explanations for particular observed facts is the most compelling one. An abductive argument is used to make a logical assumption or a best guess, so its conclusion might be false. Abductive reasoning is important in everyday life, as people constantly try to account for their observations of the world; it is also important in scientific study. An example of an abductive argument would be the claim that some particular cause is probably responsible for the things that someone has observed. Abductive reasoning can be distinguished from two other types of inference: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. An argument that employs **deductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is necessarily true if the argument succeeds. An example of a deductive argument would be the claim that since a particular object falls within a given category, and every object in that category has a certain trait, this particular object must have the trait as well. An argument that employs **inductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is not necessarily true but is simply likely or well-supported; unlike abductive reasoning, however, inductive reasoning does not involve explanations. An example of an inductive argument would be the claim that since most or all of the objects a person has observed within a given category have some feature, other objects they have not observed in that category must have the feature as well.\\n\\nTo unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.\\n\\n\\n[Create your account](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\n## Video Transcript\\n\\n## What Is Abductive Reasoning?\\n\\nYou have a cough, a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a runny nose, chills, an aching body, nausea and diarrhea. You have had these symptoms for five days. Given this information, your best guess is that you have influenza, or the flu. But you are not completely certain. This is an example of abductive reasoning.\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is to abduce (or take away) a logical assumption, explanation, inference, conclusion, hypothesis, or best guess from an observation or set of observations. Because the conclusion is merely a best guess, the conclusion that is drawn may or may not be true. Let\\'s look at some examples to gain a better understanding of this reasoning process.\\n\\n## Examples of Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nJury duty decisions are one example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re a juror and the defendant looks like the image of the man on the security camera robbing the bank. He stutters and pauses, like he is guilty, when answering questions posed by the prosecutor. You conclude, as a juror on your first day as a member of the jury, that he is guilty, but you are not certain. Here, you have made a decision based on your observations, but you are not certain it is the right decision.\\n\\nDaily decision-making is also an example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re stuck in traffic on the interstate and see ambulance and police lights about a half mile ahead. There is an exit coming up and you could take some backroads and then get back on the interstate after the accident. You listen to the traffic report on the radio. You look and see if the exit looks congested. Taking all the information at hand, you make the decision to stay on the interstate and wait for the accident to clear. You made the best decision you could given all of the observations.\\n\\n## Deductive & Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nSo, abductive reasoning is really taking an incomplete or partial list of observations about a situation and drawing an inference from these observations. It is an informal process. We use it in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. This reasoning moves from the general to the specific. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. Here is an example:\\n\\nIt is a general rule that all reptiles have scales. If an iguana is a reptile, what specific conclusion can you draw from the above general rule? Your specific conclusion would be that iguanas have scales.\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning** moves from the specific to the general, which is the opposite of deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning, which gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true. Here is an example where the general conclusion that is drawn is most likely incorrect:\\n\\nYour specific observation is that a baby didn\\'t like peaches or apples. Your general conclusion is that the baby won\\'t like any type of fruit.\\n\\n## Lesson Summary\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is a logical assumption formed by observations and which is turned into a hypothesis. In abductive reasoning, the conclusion that is drawn is merely an educated guess or hypothesis and is, therefore, not absolutely verifiable or true. We use a lot of abductive reasoning in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. **Inductive reasoning**, however, moves from the specific to the general and is the opposite of deductive reasoning. It is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning that gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true.\\n\\n### Register to view this lesson\\n\\nAre you a student or a teacher?\\n\\nI am a student\\nI am a teacher\\n\\n\\n### Unlock Your Education\\n\\n#### See for yourself why 30 million people use Study.com\\n\\n##### Become a Study.com member and start learning now.\\n\\n[Become a Member](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html#partialRegFormModal)\\n\\nAlready a member?

It was formulated and advanced by American [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher \"Philosopher\") and [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician \"Logician\") [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce \"Charles Sanders Peirce\") beginning in the latter half of the 19th century.\\n\\nAbductive reasoning, unlike [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\"), yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it. Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as \"best available\" or \"most likely\". While [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") draws general conclusions that apply to many situations, abductive conclusions are confined to the particular observations in question.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law,[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-3) [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"), and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") research[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Josephson,_Magnani-4) spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction.[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-5)\\nDiagnostic [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system \"Expert system\") frequently employ abduction.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-6)\\n\\n## Deduction, induction, and abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Deduction, induction, and abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning \"Logical reasoning\")\\n\\n### Deduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Deduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\")\\n\\nDeductive reasoning allows deriving b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) from a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) only where b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) is a formal [logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence \"Logical consequence\") of a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc). In other words, deduction derives the consequences of the assumed. Given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion. For example, given that \"Wikis can be edited by anyone\" (a1{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a\\\\_{1}}![{\\\\displaystyle a_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bbf42ecda092975c9c69dae84e16182ba5fe2e07)) and \"Wikipedia is a wiki\" (a2{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a\\\\_{2}}![{\\\\displaystyle a_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/270580da7333505d9b73697417d0543c43c98b9f)), it follows that \"Wikipedia can be edited by anyone\" (b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3)).\\n\\n### Induction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Induction\")\\\\]\\n\\nMain article: [Inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\")\\n\\nInductive reasoning is the process of inferring some _general_ principle b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) from a body of knowledge a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc), where b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) does not necessarily follow from a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc). a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) might give us very good reason to accept b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) but does not ensure b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3). For example, if it is given that 95% percent of the elephants are gray, and Louise is an elephant, one can _induce_ that Louise is gray. Still, this is not necessarily the case: 5 percent of the time this conclusion will be wrong.[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-:0-7)\\n\\nHowever, an inference being derived from statistical data is not sufficient to classify it as inductive. For example, if all swans that a person has observed so far are white, they may instead _abduce_ the possibility that all swans are white. They have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise because it is the _best explanation_ for their observations, and the truth of the conclusion is still not guaranteed. (Indeed, it turns out that [some swans are black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan \"Black swan\").)[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-:0-7)\\n\\n### Abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nAbductive reasoning allows inferring a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) as an explanation of b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3). As a result of this inference, abduction allows the precondition a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) to be abducted from the consequence b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3). [Deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\") and abductive reasoning thus differ in which end, left or right, of the proposition \"a{\\\\\\\\displaystyle a}![{\\\\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc)[entails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entailment \"Entailment\")b{\\\\\\\\displaystyle b}![{\\\\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3)\" serves as conclusion. For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the eight ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that _best explains_ our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability \"Prior probability\") in [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics \"Bayesian statistics\").\\n\\nOne can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation,[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-8) although not all usages of the terms _abduction_ and _inference to the best explanation_ are equivalent.[\\\\[9\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-9)[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-10)\\n\\n## Formalizations of abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Formalizations of abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\n### Logic-based abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Logic-based abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic \"Logic\"), [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation \"Explanation\") is accomplished through the use of a [logical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_theory \"Logical theory\")T{\\\\\\\\displaystyle T}![{\\\\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0) representing a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse \"Domain of discourse\") and a set of observations O{\\\\\\\\displaystyle O}![{\\\\displaystyle O}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d70e1d0d87e2ef1092ea1ffe2923d9933ff18fc).

This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation.\\\\[ _[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_\\\\] Under this principle, an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data. The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance (see [Occam\\'s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science \"Science\"); moreover, Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought:\\n\\n> Looking out my window this lovely spring morning, I see an azalea in full bloom. No, no! I don\\'t see that; though that is the only way I can describe what I see. That is a proposition, a sentence, a fact; but what I perceive is not proposition, sentence, fact, but only an image, which I make intelligible in part by means of a statement of fact. This statement is abstract; but what I see is concrete. I perform an abduction when I so much as express in a sentence anything I see. The truth is that the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction. Not the smallest advance can be made in knowledge beyond the stage of vacant staring, without making an abduction at every step.[\\\\[13\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-13)\\n\\nIt was Peirce\\'s own maxim that \"Facts cannot be explained by a hypothesis more extraordinary than these facts themselves; and of various hypotheses the least extraordinary must be adopted.\"[\\\\[14\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-14) After obtaining possible hypotheses that may explain the facts, abductive validation is a method for identifying the most likely hypothesis that should be adopted.\\n\\n### Subjective logic abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Subjective logic abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\n[Subjective logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_logic \"Subjective logic\") generalises [probabilistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic \"Probabilistic logic\") by including degrees of epistemic [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification \"Uncertainty quantification\") in the input arguments, i.e. instead of probabilities, the analyst can express arguments as [subjective opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_logic \"Subjective logic\"). Abduction in subjective logic is thus a generalization of probabilistic abduction described above.[\\\\[15\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Josang2016-SL-15) The input arguments in subjective logic are subjective opinions which can be binomial when the opinion applies to a binary variable or multinomial when it applies to an _n_-ary variable.

Over the years he called such inference _hypothesis_, _abduction_, _presumption_, and _retroduction_. He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy, not in purely formal or mathematical logic, and eventually as a topic also in economics of research.\\n\\nAs two stages of the development, extension, etc., of a hypothesis in scientific [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\"), abduction and also [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") are often collapsed into one overarching concept—the hypothesis. That is why, in the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method \"Scientific method\") known from [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei \"Galileo Galilei\") and [Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon \"Francis Bacon\"), the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction. Thus, in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper \"Karl Popper\")\\'s explication of the [hypothetico-deductive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model \"Hypothetico-deductive model\"), where the hypothesis is considered to be just \"a guess\"[\\\\[17\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-17) (in the spirit of Peirce). However, when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this \"guess\" has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis. Indeed, many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage.\\n\\nBefore 1900, Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation. For instance: it is a known rule that, if it rains, grass gets wet; so, to explain the fact that the grass on this lawn is wet, one _abduces_ that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules that might explain the observation are not taken into account—e.g. the grass could be wet from [dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew \"Dew\"). This remains the common use of the term \"abduction\" in the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science \"Social science\") and in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\").\\n\\nPeirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation, though an unassured one, for some very curious or surprising (anomalous) observation stated in a premise. As early as 1865 he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference; in the 1900s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction. In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years.[\\\\[18\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-18)\\n\\nIn later years his view came to be:\\n\\n- Abduction is guessing.[\\\\[19\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-guess-19) It is \"very little hampered\" by rules of logic.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20) Even a well-prepared mind\\'s individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right.[\\\\[21\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-21) But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) (some speak of [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition \"Logical intuition\") in such contexts[\\\\[23\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-23)).\\n- Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible, instinctive, economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon. That is its proximate aim.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22)\\n- Its longer aim is to economize [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") itself. Its rationale is inductive: it works often enough, is the only source of new ideas, and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths.[\\\\[24\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-24) Its rationale especially involves its role in coordination with other modes of inference in inquiry. It is inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying.\\n- [Pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") is the logic of abduction. Upon the generation of an explanation (which he came to regard as instinctively guided), the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general.

Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles, predicates, and subjects. For example: All _men_ \\\\[middle\\\\] are _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]; _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is a _man_ \\\\[middle\\\\]; ergo _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]\". Below, \\'M\\' stands for a middle; \\'P\\' for a predicate; \\'S\\' for a subject.

In the forms themselves, it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a \"very curious circumstance\". The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another\\'s propositions (without the bracketed hints shown below).\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Deduction.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Result:_ These beans are white. | Induction.<br>_Case:_ These beans are \\\\[randomly selected\\\\] from this bag. <br>_Result:_ These beans are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. | Hypothesis.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Result:_ These beans \\\\[oddly\\\\] are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. |\\n\\n#### _A Theory of Probable Inference_ (1883)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: A Theory of Probable Inference (1883)\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits (weighed, not counted like objects), explicitly so in his influential 1883 \"A theory of probable inference\", in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion.[\\\\[37\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Pierce-1883-37) Like \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" in 1878, it was widely read (see the historical books on statistics by [Stephen Stigler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stigler \"Stephen Stigler\")), unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction. Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances.\\n\\n[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes \"Sherlock Holmes\") used this method of reasoning in the stories of [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle \"Arthur Conan Doyle\"), although Holmes refers to it as \" [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\")\".[\\\\[38\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-38)[\\\\[39\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-39)[\\\\[40\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-40)\\n\\n#### _Minute Logic_ (1902) and after\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Minute Logic (1902) and after\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1902 Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension (i.e., objects and characters as referenced by terms), as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought.[\\\\[41\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-41) In 1903 he offered the following form for abduction:[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20)\\n\\n> The surprising fact, C, is observed;\\n>\\n> But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.\\n\\nThe hypothesis is framed, but not asserted, in a premise, then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion. Thus, as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form, the conclusion is formulated from some premise(s). But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed. Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises, but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences, or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis; either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts.\\n\\nNote that the hypothesis (\"A\") could be of a rule. It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation (\"C\"), which needs to follow only as a \"matter of course\"; or the \"course\" itself could amount to some known rule, merely alluded to, and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity. In the same year, Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts, so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely.[\\\\[35\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-newidea-35)\\n\\nPeirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the 1903 form. In 1911, he wrote, \"I do not, at present, feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all \\'Retroductions\\'. For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind.\"[\\\\[36\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-kehler-36)\\n\\n#### Pragmatism\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Pragmatism\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1901 Peirce wrote, \"There would be no logic in imposing rules, and saying that they ought to be followed, until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them.\"[\\\\[42\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-42) In 1903 Peirce called [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") \"the logic of abduction\" and said that the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general.[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) The pragmatic maxim is:\\n\\n> Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\\n\\nIt is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object\\'s conceived effects. Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction\\'s purpose in inquiry, the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct. In various writings in the 1900s[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28)[\\\\[43\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-43) he said that the conduct of abduction (or retroduction) is governed by considerations of economy, belonging in particular to the economics of research. He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic (that is, theory of inquiry).[\\\\[44\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-44)\\n\\n#### Three levels of logic about abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Three levels of logic about abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce came over the years to [divide (philosophical) logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_the_sciences_(Peirce)#Sciences \"Classification of the sciences (Peirce)\") into three departments:\\n\\n1. Stechiology, or speculative grammar, on the conditions for meaningfulness. Classification of signs (semblances, symptoms, symbols, etc.) and their combinations (as well as their objects and [interpretants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretant \"Interpretant\")).\\n2. Logical critic, or logic proper, on validity or justifiability of inference, the conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various modes (deduction, induction, abduction).\\n3. Methodeutic, or speculative rhetoric, on the conditions for determination of interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its interplay of modes.\\n\\nPeirce had, from the start, seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and, by the 1900s, held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion, one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found, predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis. That is [Peirce\\'s outline of the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#Scientific_method \"Charles Sanders Peirce\") of inquiry, as covered in his inquiry methodology, which includes [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") or, as he later called it, [pragmaticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmaticism \"Pragmaticism\"), the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice.\\n\\n##### Classification of signs\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Classification of signs\")\\\\]\\n\\nAs early as 1866,[\\\\[45\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-45) Peirce held that:\\n\\n1\\\\. Hypothesis (abductive inference) is inference through an _icon_ (also called a _likeness_).\\n\\n2\\\\. Induction is inference through an _index_ (a sign by factual connection); a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn.\\n\\n3\\\\. Deduction is inference through a _symbol_ (a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object).\\n\\nIn 1902, Peirce wrote that, in abduction: \"It is recognized that the phenomena are _like_, i.e. constitute an Icon of, a replica of a general conception, or Symbol.\"[\\\\[46\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-46)\\n\\n##### Critique of arguments\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Critique of arguments\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments (as discussed above), and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural. In 1908 Peirce described this plausibility in some detail.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) It involves not likeliness based on observations (which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis), but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo\\'s natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\" (Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role; taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all). Even a well-prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right, but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry, and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature, an affinity between the mind\\'s processes and the processes of the real, which would account for why appealingly \"natural\" guesses are the ones that oftenest (or least seldom) succeed; to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since, without \"a natural bent like nature\\'s\", people would have no hope of understanding nature. In 1910 Peirce made a three-way distinction between probability, verisimilitude, and plausibility, and defined plausibility with a normative \"ought\": \"By plausibility, I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably.\"[\\\\[47\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-47) For Peirce, plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities, or on verisimilitude, or even on testability, which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference _as_ an inference, but rather a question of the hypothesis\\'s relation to the inquiry process.\\n\\nThe phrase \"inference to the best explanation\" (not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference) is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses (such as those with the [fewest assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). However, in other senses of \"best\", such as \"standing up best to tests\", it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form, since one has not tested it yet. Still, for Peirce, any justification of an abductive inference as \"good\" is not completed upon its formation as an argument (unlike with induction and deduction) and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise (such as its testability) in advancing inquiry.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27)[\\\\[48\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-48)\\n\\n##### Methodology of inquiry\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Methodology of inquiry\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26) for testing because it offers, via its trial, to expedite and economize the [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") process itself toward new truths, first of all by being testable and also by further economies,[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28) in terms of cost, value, and relationships among guesses (hypotheses). Here, considerations such as probability, absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level, come into play. For examples:\\n\\n- Cost: A simple but low-odds guess, if low in cost to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing, to get it out of the way. If surprisingly it stands up to tests, that is worth knowing early in the inquiry, which otherwise might have stayed long on a wrong though seemingly likelier track.\\n- Value: A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctual plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [subjective likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_probability \"Subjective probability\"), though reasoned, can be treacherous.\\n- Interrelationships: Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically for their\\n  - _caution_, for which Peirce gave as an example the game of [Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions \"Twenty Questions\"),\\n  - _breadth_ of applicability to explain various phenomena, and\\n  - _incomplexity_, that of a hypothesis that seems too simple but whose trial \"may give a good \\'leave\\', as the billiard-players say\", and be instructive for the pursuit of various and conflicting hypotheses that are less simple.[\\\\[49\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ2-49)\\n\\n#### Uberty\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Uberty\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce[\\\\[50\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-50) indicated that abductive reasoning is driven by the need for \"economy in research\"—the expected fact-based productivity of hypotheses, prior to deductive and inductive processes of verification. A key concept proposed by him in this regard is \" [uberty](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uberty \"wiktionary:uberty\")\"[\\\\[51\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-51)—the expected fertility and pragmatic value of reasoning. This concept seems to be gaining support via association to the [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle \"Free energy principle\").[\\\\[52\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-52)\\n\\n### Gilbert Harman (1965)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Gilbert Harman (1965)\")\\\\]\\n\\n[Gilbert Harman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Harman \"Gilbert Harman\") was a professor of philosophy at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University \"Princeton University\").

The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the prior [web of beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_belief \"Web of belief\"), while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent. The process of updating the web of beliefs can be done by the use of abduction: once an explanation for the observation has been found, integrating it does not generate inconsistency.\\n\\nGärdenfors’ paper[\\\\[58\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-G%C3%A4rdenfors-58) contains a brief survey of the area of belief revision and its relation to updating of logical databases, and explores the relationship between belief revision and nonmonotonic logic.\\n\\nThis use of abduction is not straightforward, as adding [propositional formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_formula \"Propositional formula\") to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse. Instead, abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world \"Possible world\"). Preference models use [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic \"Fuzzy logic\") or [utility models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_models \"Utility models\").\\n\\n### Philosophy of science\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit section: Philosophy of science\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science \"Philosophy of science\"), abduction has been the key inference method to support [scientific realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_realism \"Scientific realism\"), and much of the debate about scientific realism is focused on whether abduction is an acceptable method of inference.[\\\\[59\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-59)\\n\\n### Historical linguistics\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit section: Historical linguistics\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [historical linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics \"Historical linguistics\"), abduction during language acquisition is often taken to be an essential part of processes of [language change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change \"Language change\") such as reanalysis and [analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy \"Analogy\").[\\\\[60\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-60)\\n\\n### Applied linguistics\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit section: Applied linguistics\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [applied linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_linguistics \"Applied linguistics\") research, abductive reasoning is starting to be used as an alternative explanation to inductive reasoning, in recognition of anticipated outcomes of qualitative inquiry playing a role in shaping the direction of analysis. It is defined as \"The use of an unclear premise based on observations, pursuing theories to try to explain it\" (Rose et al., 2020, p.\\xa0258)[\\\\[61\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-61)[\\\\[62\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-62)\\n\\n### Anthropology\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: Anthropology\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology \"Anthropology\"), [Alfred Gell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gell \"Alfred Gell\") in his influential book _Art and Agency_ defined abduction (after Eco[\\\\[63\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-63)) as \"a case of synthetic inference \\'where we find some very curious circumstances, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt that supposition\\'\".[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) Gell criticizes existing \"anthropological\" studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering \"social relationships\", specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced, circulated, and received.[\\\\[65\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-65) Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency. That is, abduction can explain how works of art inspire a _sensus communis:_ the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\nThe question Gell asks in the book is, \"how does it initially \\'speak\\' to people?\" He answers by saying that \"No reasonable person could suppose that art-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of [semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis \"Semiosis\").\"[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) However, he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre-established existence of the _sensus communis_ that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art. Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept (Peirce likened it to guessing) means that not only can it operate outside of any pre-existing framework, but moreover, it can actually intimate the existence of a framework. As Gell reasons in his analysis, the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality. A statue of a goddess, for example, in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder; and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions (which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence). Therefore, through abduction, Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths. The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\n### Computer programming\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Computer programming\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods \"Formal methods\"), logic is used to specify and prove properties of computer programs. Abduction has been used in mechanized reasoning tools to increase the level of automation of the proof activity.\\n\\nA technique known as bi-abduction, which mixes abduction and the [frame problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem \"Frame problem\"), was used to scale reasoning techniques for memory properties to millions of lines of code;[\\\\[67\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-67) logic-based abduction was used to infer pre-conditions for individual functions in a program, relieving the human of the need to do so. It led to a program-proof startup company, which was acquired by Facebook,[\\\\[68\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-68) and the Infer program analysis tool, which led to thousands of bugs being prevented in industrial codebases.[\\\\[69\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-69)\\n\\nIn addition to inference of function preconditions, abduction has been used to automate inference of invariants for program loops,[\\\\[70\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-70) inference of specifications of unknown code,[\\\\[71\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-71) and in synthesis of the programs themselves.[\\\\[72\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-72)\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=36 \"Edit section: See also\")\\\\]\\n\\n- ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/36px-Socrates.png)[Philosophy portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Philosophy \"Portal:Philosophy\")\\n\\n- [Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument \"Argument\")\\xa0– Attempt to persuade or to determine the truth of a conclusion\\n- [Argumentation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory \"Argumentation theory\")\\xa0– Academic field of logic and rhetoric\\n- [Attribution (psychology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology) \"Attribution (psychology)\")\\xa0– Process by which individuals explain causes of behavior and events\\n- [Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce_bibliography \"Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography\")\\n- [Critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking \"Critical thinking\")\\xa0– Analysis of facts to form a judgment\\n- [Defeasible reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning \"Defeasible reasoning\")\\xa0– Reasoning that is rationally compelling, though not deductively valid\\n- [Douglas N.

There is then a two-fold problem with the claim that abduction is IBE. On the one hand, it conflates abduction and induction, which are two distinct forms of logical inference, with two distinct aims, as shown by Charles S.

It was formulated and advanced by American [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher \"Philosopher\") and [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician \"Logician\") [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce \"Charles Sanders Peirce\") beginning in the latter half of the 19th century.\\n\\nAbductive reasoning, unlike [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\"), yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it. Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as \"best available\" or \"most likely\".

For example, if it is given that 95% percent of the elephants are gray, and Louise is an elephant, one can _induce_ that Louise is gray. Still, this is not necessarily the case: 5 percent of the time this conclusion will be wrong.[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-:0-7)\\n\\nHowever, an inference being derived from statistical data is not sufficient to classify it as inductive. For example, if all swans that a person has observed so far are white, they may instead _abduce_ the possibility that all swans are white. They have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise because it is the _best explanation_ for their observations, and the truth of the conclusion is still not guaranteed.

For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the eight ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that _best explains_ our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability \"Prior probability\") in [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics \"Bayesian statistics\").\\n\\nOne can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation,[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-8) although not all usages of the terms _abduction_ and _inference to the best explanation_ are equivalent.[\\\\[9\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-9)[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-10)\\n\\n## Formalizations of abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Formalizations of abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\n### Logic-based abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Logic-based abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic \"Logic\"), [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation \"Explanation\") is accomplished through the use of a [logical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_theory \"Logical theory\")T{\\\\\\\\displaystyle T}![{\\\\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0) representing a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse \"Domain of discourse\") and a set of observations O{\\\\\\\\displaystyle O}![{\\\\displaystyle O}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d70e1d0d87e2ef1092ea1ffe2923d9933ff18fc).

This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation.\\\\[ _[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_\\\\] Under this principle, an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data. The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance (see [Occam\\'s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science \"Science\"); moreover, Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought:\\n\\n> Looking out my window this lovely spring morning, I see an azalea in full bloom. No, no! I don\\'t see that; though that is the only way I can describe what I see. That is a proposition, a sentence, a fact; but what I perceive is not proposition, sentence, fact, but only an image, which I make intelligible in part by means of a statement of fact. This statement is abstract; but what I see is concrete. I perform an abduction when I so much as express in a sentence anything I see. The truth is that the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction.

Over the years he called such inference _hypothesis_, _abduction_, _presumption_, and _retroduction_. He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy, not in purely formal or mathematical logic, and eventually as a topic also in economics of research.\\n\\nAs two stages of the development, extension, etc., of a hypothesis in scientific [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\"), abduction and also [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning \"Inductive reasoning\") are often collapsed into one overarching concept—the hypothesis. That is why, in the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method \"Scientific method\") known from [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei \"Galileo Galilei\") and [Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon \"Francis Bacon\"), the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction. Thus, in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper \"Karl Popper\")\\'s explication of the [hypothetico-deductive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model \"Hypothetico-deductive model\"), where the hypothesis is considered to be just \"a guess\"[\\\\[17\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-17) (in the spirit of Peirce). However, when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this \"guess\" has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis. Indeed, many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage.\\n\\nBefore 1900, Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation. For instance: it is a known rule that, if it rains, grass gets wet; so, to explain the fact that the grass on this lawn is wet, one _abduces_ that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules that might explain the observation are not taken into account—e.g. the grass could be wet from [dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew \"Dew\"). This remains the common use of the term \"abduction\" in the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science \"Social science\") and in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\").\\n\\nPeirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation, though an unassured one, for some very curious or surprising (anomalous) observation stated in a premise. As early as 1865 he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference; in the 1900s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction. In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years.[\\\\[18\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-18)\\n\\nIn later years his view came to be:\\n\\n- Abduction is guessing.[\\\\[19\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-guess-19) It is \"very little hampered\" by rules of logic.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20) Even a well-prepared mind\\'s individual guesses are more frequently wrong than right.[\\\\[21\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-21) But the success of our guesses far exceeds that of random luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instinct[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) (some speak of [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition \"Logical intuition\") in such contexts[\\\\[23\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-23)).\\n- Abduction guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a plausible, instinctive, economical way for a surprising or very complicated phenomenon. That is its proximate aim.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22)\\n- Its longer aim is to economize [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") itself. Its rationale is inductive: it works often enough, is the only source of new ideas, and has no substitute in expediting the discovery of new truths.[\\\\[24\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-24) Its rationale especially involves its role in coordination with other modes of inference in inquiry. It is inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying.\\n- [Pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") is the logic of abduction. Upon the generation of an explanation (which he came to regard as instinctively guided), the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have conceivable[\\\\[25\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-25) implications for informed practice, so as to be testable[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) and, through its trials, to expedite and economize inquiry. The economy of research is what calls for abduction and governs its art.[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28)\\n\\nWriting in 1910, Peirce admits that \"in almost everything I printed before the beginning of this century I more or less mixed up hypothesis and induction\" and he traces the confusion of these two types of reasoning to logicians\\' too \"narrow and formalistic a conception of inference, as necessarily having formulated judgments from its premises.\"[\\\\[29\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-29)\\n\\nHe started out in the 1860s treating hypothetical inference in a number of ways which he eventually peeled away as inessential or, in some cases, mistaken:\\n\\n- as inferring the occurrence of a character (a characteristic) from the observed combined occurrence of multiple characters which its occurrence would necessarily involve;[\\\\[30\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NCA-30) for example, if any occurrence of _A_ is known to necessitate occurrence of _B, C, D, E_, then the observation of _B, C, D, E_ suggests by way of explanation the occurrence of _A_. (But by 1878 he no longer regarded such multiplicity as common to all hypothetical inference.[\\\\[31\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-DIH-31) [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_13/August_1878/Illustrations_of_the_Logic_of_Science_VI))\\n- as aiming for a more or less probable hypothesis (in 1867 and 1883 but not in 1878; anyway by 1900 the justification is not probability but the lack of alternatives to guessing and the fact that guessing is fruitful;[\\\\[32\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L2L-32) by 1903 he speaks of the \"likely\" in the sense of nearing the truth in an \"indefinite sense\";[\\\\[33\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-33) by 1908 he discusses _plausibility_ as instinctive appeal.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22)) In a paper dated by editors as _circa_ 1901, he discusses \"instinct\" and \"naturalness\", along with the kind of considerations (low cost of testing, logical caution, breadth, and incomplexity) that he later calls methodeutical.[\\\\[34\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-34)\\n- as induction from characters (but as early as 1900 he characterized abduction as guessing[\\\\[32\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L2L-32))\\n- as citing a known rule in a premise rather than hypothesizing a rule in the conclusion (but by 1903 he allowed either approach[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20)[\\\\[35\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-newidea-35))\\n- as basically a transformation of a deductive categorical syllogism[\\\\[31\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-DIH-31) (but in 1903 he offered a variation on _modus ponens_ instead,[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20) and by 1911 he was unconvinced that any one form covers all hypothetical inference[\\\\[36\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-kehler-36)).\\n\\n#### _The Natural Classification of Arguments_ (1867)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: The Natural Classification of Arguments (1867)\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1867, Peirce\\'s \"On the Natural Classification of Arguments\",[\\\\[30\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NCA-30) hypothetical inference always deals with a cluster of characters (call them _P′, P′′, P′′′,_ etc.) known to occur at least whenever a certain character ( _M_) occurs. Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles, predicates, and subjects. For example: All _men_ \\\\[middle\\\\] are _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]; _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is a _man_ \\\\[middle\\\\]; ergo _Socrates_ \\\\[subject\\\\] is _mortal_ \\\\[predicate\\\\]\". Below, \\'M\\' stands for a middle; \\'P\\' for a predicate; \\'S\\' for a subject. Peirce held that all deduction can be put into the form of the categorical [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism \"Syllogism\") [Barbara (AAA-1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism#Barbara_(AAA-1) \"Syllogism\").\\n\\n> |     |     |     |\\n> | --- | --- | --- |\\n> | \\\\[Deduction\\\\].<br>\\\\[Any\\\\] M is P <br>\\\\[Any\\\\] S is M <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22) \\\\[Any\\\\] S is P. | Induction.<br>_S′, S′′, S′′′_, &c. are taken at random as _M\\'_ s; <br>_S′, S′′, S′′′_, &c. are _P_: <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22) Any _M_ is probably _P_. | Hypothesis.<br>Any _M_ is, for instance, _P′, P′′, P′′′,_ &c.; <br>_S_ is _P′, P′′, P′′′,_ &c.: <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_S_ is probably _M_. |\\n\\n#### _Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis_ (1878)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis (1878)\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1878, in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\",[\\\\[31\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-DIH-31) there is no longer a need for multiple characters or predicates in order for an inference to be hypothetical, although it is still helpful. Moreover, Peirce no longer poses hypothetical inference as concluding in a _probable_ hypothesis. In the forms themselves, it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a \"very curious circumstance\". The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another\\'s propositions (without the bracketed hints shown below).\\n\\n|     |     |     |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Deduction.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Result:_ These beans are white. | Induction.<br>_Case:_ These beans are \\\\[randomly selected\\\\] from this bag. <br>_Result:_ These beans are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. | Hypothesis.<br>_Rule:_ All the beans from this bag are white. <br>_Result:_ These beans \\\\[oddly\\\\] are white. <br>∴{\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\therefore }![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\therefore }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbb8b7f072bd54b28a08d8f7ad207f9df1bf9f22)_Case:_ These beans are from this bag. |\\n\\n#### _A Theory of Probable Inference_ (1883)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: A Theory of Probable Inference (1883)\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits (weighed, not counted like objects), explicitly so in his influential 1883 \"A theory of probable inference\", in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion.[\\\\[37\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Pierce-1883-37) Like \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" in 1878, it was widely read (see the historical books on statistics by [Stephen Stigler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stigler \"Stephen Stigler\")), unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction. Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances.\\n\\n[Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes \"Sherlock Holmes\") used this method of reasoning in the stories of [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle \"Arthur Conan Doyle\"), although Holmes refers to it as \" [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\")\".[\\\\[38\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-38)[\\\\[39\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-39)[\\\\[40\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-40)\\n\\n#### _Minute Logic_ (1902) and after\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Minute Logic (1902) and after\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1902 Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension (i.e., objects and characters as referenced by terms), as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought.[\\\\[41\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-41) In 1903 he offered the following form for abduction:[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-HL-20)\\n\\n> The surprising fact, C, is observed;\\n>\\n> But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.\\n\\nThe hypothesis is framed, but not asserted, in a premise, then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion. Thus, as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form, the conclusion is formulated from some premise(s). But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed. Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises, but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences, or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis; either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts.\\n\\nNote that the hypothesis (\"A\") could be of a rule. It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation (\"C\"), which needs to follow only as a \"matter of course\"; or the \"course\" itself could amount to some known rule, merely alluded to, and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity. In the same year, Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts, so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely.[\\\\[35\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-newidea-35)\\n\\nPeirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the 1903 form. In 1911, he wrote, \"I do not, at present, feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all \\'Retroductions\\'. For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind.\"[\\\\[36\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-kehler-36)\\n\\n#### Pragmatism\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Pragmatism\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn 1901 Peirce wrote, \"There would be no logic in imposing rules, and saying that they ought to be followed, until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them.\"[\\\\[42\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-42) In 1903 Peirce called [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") \"the logic of abduction\" and said that the [pragmatic maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim \"Pragmatic maxim\") gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general.[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) The pragmatic maxim is:\\n\\n> Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\\n\\nIt is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object\\'s conceived effects. Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction\\'s purpose in inquiry, the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct. In various writings in the 1900s[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28)[\\\\[43\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-43) he said that the conduct of abduction (or retroduction) is governed by considerations of economy, belonging in particular to the economics of research. He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic (that is, theory of inquiry).[\\\\[44\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-44)\\n\\n#### Three levels of logic about abduction\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Three levels of logic about abduction\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce came over the years to [divide (philosophical) logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_the_sciences_(Peirce)#Sciences \"Classification of the sciences (Peirce)\") into three departments:\\n\\n1. Stechiology, or speculative grammar, on the conditions for meaningfulness. Classification of signs (semblances, symptoms, symbols, etc.) and their combinations (as well as their objects and [interpretants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretant \"Interpretant\")).\\n2. Logical critic, or logic proper, on validity or justifiability of inference, the conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various modes (deduction, induction, abduction).\\n3. Methodeutic, or speculative rhetoric, on the conditions for determination of interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its interplay of modes.\\n\\nPeirce had, from the start, seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and, by the 1900s, held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27) To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion, one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found, predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis. That is [Peirce\\'s outline of the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#Scientific_method \"Charles Sanders Peirce\") of inquiry, as covered in his inquiry methodology, which includes [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism \"Pragmatism\") or, as he later called it, [pragmaticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmaticism \"Pragmaticism\"), the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice.\\n\\n##### Classification of signs\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Classification of signs\")\\\\]\\n\\nAs early as 1866,[\\\\[45\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-45) Peirce held that:\\n\\n1\\\\. Hypothesis (abductive inference) is inference through an _icon_ (also called a _likeness_).\\n\\n2\\\\. Induction is inference through an _index_ (a sign by factual connection); a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn.\\n\\n3\\\\. Deduction is inference through a _symbol_ (a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object).\\n\\nIn 1902, Peirce wrote that, in abduction: \"It is recognized that the phenomena are _like_, i.e. constitute an Icon of, a replica of a general conception, or Symbol.\"[\\\\[46\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-46)\\n\\n##### Critique of arguments\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Critique of arguments\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments (as discussed above), and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural. In 1908 Peirce described this plausibility in some detail.[\\\\[22\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-NA-22) It involves not likeliness based on observations (which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis), but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo\\'s natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\" (Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role; taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all). Even a well-prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right, but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry, and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature, an affinity between the mind\\'s processes and the processes of the real, which would account for why appealingly \"natural\" guesses are the ones that oftenest (or least seldom) succeed; to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since, without \"a natural bent like nature\\'s\", people would have no hope of understanding nature. In 1910 Peirce made a three-way distinction between probability, verisimilitude, and plausibility, and defined plausibility with a normative \"ought\": \"By plausibility, I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably.\"[\\\\[47\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-47) For Peirce, plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities, or on verisimilitude, or even on testability, which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference _as_ an inference, but rather a question of the hypothesis\\'s relation to the inquiry process.\\n\\nThe phrase \"inference to the best explanation\" (not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference) is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses (such as those with the [fewest assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor \"Occam\\'s razor\")). However, in other senses of \"best\", such as \"standing up best to tests\", it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form, since one has not tested it yet. Still, for Peirce, any justification of an abductive inference as \"good\" is not completed upon its formation as an argument (unlike with induction and deduction) and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise (such as its testability) in advancing inquiry.[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26)[\\\\[27\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-prag-27)[\\\\[48\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-48)\\n\\n##### Methodology of inquiry\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Methodology of inquiry\")\\\\]\\n\\nAt the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected[\\\\[26\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-L75-26) for testing because it offers, via its trial, to expedite and economize the [inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry \"Inquiry\") process itself toward new truths, first of all by being testable and also by further economies,[\\\\[28\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ-28) in terms of cost, value, and relationships among guesses (hypotheses). Here, considerations such as probability, absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level, come into play. For examples:\\n\\n- Cost: A simple but low-odds guess, if low in cost to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing, to get it out of the way. If surprisingly it stands up to tests, that is worth knowing early in the inquiry, which otherwise might have stayed long on a wrong though seemingly likelier track.\\n- Value: A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctual plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [subjective likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_probability \"Subjective probability\"), though reasoned, can be treacherous.\\n- Interrelationships: Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically for their\\n  - _caution_, for which Peirce gave as an example the game of [Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions \"Twenty Questions\"),\\n  - _breadth_ of applicability to explain various phenomena, and\\n  - _incomplexity_, that of a hypothesis that seems too simple but whose trial \"may give a good \\'leave\\', as the billiard-players say\", and be instructive for the pursuit of various and conflicting hypotheses that are less simple.[\\\\[49\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-econ2-49)\\n\\n#### Uberty\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Uberty\")\\\\]\\n\\nPeirce[\\\\[50\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-50) indicated that abductive reasoning is driven by the need for \"economy in research\"—the expected fact-based productivity of hypotheses, prior to deductive and inductive processes of verification. A key concept proposed by him in this regard is \" [uberty](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uberty \"wiktionary:uberty\")\"[\\\\[51\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-51)—the expected fertility and pragmatic value of reasoning. This concept seems to be gaining support via association to the [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle \"Free energy principle\").[\\\\[52\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-52)\\n\\n### Gilbert Harman (1965)\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Gilbert Harman (1965)\")\\\\]\\n\\n[Gilbert Harman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Harman \"Gilbert Harman\") was a professor of philosophy at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University \"Princeton University\").

The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the prior [web of beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_belief \"Web of belief\"), while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent. The process of updating the web of beliefs can be done by the use of abduction: once an explanation for the observation has been found, integrating it does not generate inconsistency.\\n\\nGärdenfors’ paper[\\\\[58\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-G%C3%A4rdenfors-58) contains a brief survey of the area of belief revision and its relation to updating of logical databases, and explores the relationship between belief revision and nonmonotonic logic.\\n\\nThis use of abduction is not straightforward, as adding [propositional formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_formula \"Propositional formula\") to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse. Instead, abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world \"Possible world\").

It is defined as \"The use of an unclear premise based on observations, pursuing theories to try to explain it\" (Rose et al., 2020, p.\\xa0258)[\\\\[61\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-61)[\\\\[62\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-62)\\n\\n### Anthropology\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: Anthropology\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology \"Anthropology\"), [Alfred Gell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gell \"Alfred Gell\") in his influential book _Art and Agency_ defined abduction (after Eco[\\\\[63\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-63)) as \"a case of synthetic inference \\'where we find some very curious circumstances, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt that supposition\\'\".[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) Gell criticizes existing \"anthropological\" studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering \"social relationships\", specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced, circulated, and received.[\\\\[65\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-65) Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency. That is, abduction can explain how works of art inspire a _sensus communis:_ the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\nThe question Gell asks in the book is, \"how does it initially \\'speak\\' to people?\" He answers by saying that \"No reasonable person could suppose that art-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of [semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis \"Semiosis\").\"[\\\\[64\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-Gell,_A_1984,_p_14-64) However, he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre-established existence of the _sensus communis_ that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art. Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept (Peirce likened it to guessing) means that not only can it operate outside of any pre-existing framework, but moreover, it can actually intimate the existence of a framework. As Gell reasons in his analysis, the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality. A statue of a goddess, for example, in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder; and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions (which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence). Therefore, through abduction, Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths. The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society.[\\\\[66\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_note-University_of_California,_Berkeley-66)\\n\\n### Computer programming\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abductive_reasoning&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Computer programming\")\\\\]\\n\\nIn [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods \"Formal methods\"), logic is used to specify and prove properties of computer programs.

I argue against the tendency in the philosophy of science literature to link abduction to the inference to the best explanation (IBE), and in particular, to claim that Peircean abduction is a conceptual predecessor to IBE. \\\\[...\\\\] In particular, I claim that Peircean abduction is an in-depth account of the process of generating explanatory hypotheses, while IBE, at least in [Peter Lipton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lipton \"Peter Lipton\")\\'s thorough treatment, is a more encompassing account of the processes both of generating and of evaluating scientific hypotheses. There is then a two-fold problem with the claim that abduction is IBE. On the one hand, it conflates abduction and induction, which are two distinct forms of logical inference, with two distinct aims, as shown by Charles S. Peirce; on the other hand it lacks a clear sense of the full scope of IBE as an account of scientific inference.\\n10. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_ref-10 \"Jump up\")**[Walton, Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_N._Walton \"Douglas N.

It is necessary to add that this brief account may be misleading in some respects, and that a closer and more detailed explication of the finer points of the three analyses could reveal important underlying philosophical differences.

Sherlock Holmes, although a fictional character, remains renowned as a great detective. However, his methodology, which was _abduction_ rather than deduction, and which is innocently used by many real detectives, is rarely described, discussed, or researched. This paper compares and contrasts the three forms of inferential reasoning, and makes a case for articulating and developing the role of abduction in the work, and training, of police officers.\\n41. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#cite_ref-41 \"Jump up\")**In Peirce, C.

\\'Abduction\\'\\n\\nLearn the differences between these three types of reasoning\\n\\n> What to Know\\n>\\n> Deductive reasoning, or _deduction_, is making an inference based on widely accepted facts or premises. If a beverage is defined as \"drinkable through a straw,\" one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage. Inductive reasoning, or _induction_, is making an inference based on an observation, and often an observation of a sample. You can induce that the soup is tasty if you observe all of your friends happily consuming it. Abductive reasoning, or _abduction_, is making a probable conclusion from what you know. If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup on the table, you can use abduction to conclude the owner of the soup is likely returning soon.\\n\\nDo you have to figure out what time you need to leave your house for an appointment? Or are you trying to decide the best choice for lunch? Or are you baffled about why a half-eaten sandwich is on the counter? These situations call for some method of reasoning, and there are three that we use daily: [_deduction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduction), [_induction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induction), and _abduction_.\\n\\n![hot dog](https://merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/images/article/art-wap-article-main/hot-dog-2616-5d6d762c31b7b116b204cc8a3286d7c6@2x.jpg)\\n\\nIn abductive reasoning, the major premise is evident, but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion are only probable. For example, if you find a half-eaten sandwich in your home, you might use probability to reason that your teenage son made the sandwich, realized he was late for work, and abandoned it before he could finish it.\\n\\n## Deductive Reasoning\\n\\n_Deduction_ is generally defined as \"the deriving of a conclusion by reasoning.\" Its specific meaning in [logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic) is \" [inference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inference) in which the conclusion about particulars follows necessarily from general or universal [premises](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premise).\" Simply put, deduction—or the process of [deducing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduce)—is the formation of a conclusion based on generally accepted statements or facts. It occurs when you are planning out trips, for instance. Say you have a 10 o\\'clock appointment with the dentist and you know that it takes 30 minutes to drive from your house to the dentist\\'s. From those two facts, you deduce that you will have to leave your house at 9:30, at the latest, to be at the dentist\\'s on time.\\n\\nDeductive reasoning always follows necessarily from general or universal premises. If a sandwich is defined as \"two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between,\" and a hot dog is defined as \"a frankfurter; especially : a frankfurter heated and served in a long split roll\" then one must deduce that [any hot dog served in a split roll is a sandwich](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/to-chew-on-10-kinds-of-sandwiches/hot-dog).\\n\\n## Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nWhereas in deduction the truth of the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the statements or facts considered (the hot dog is served in a split roll and a split roll with a filling in the middle is a sandwich), induction is a method of reasoning involving an element of [probability](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/probability). In logic, _induction_ refers specifically to \"inference of a generalized conclusion from particular instances.\" In other words, it means forming a generalization based on what is known or observed. For example, at lunch you observe 4 of your 6 coworkers ordering the same sandwich. From your observation, you then [induce](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induce) that the sandwich is probably good—and you decide to try it yourself. Induction is at play here since your reasoning is based on an observation of a small group, as opposed to universal premises.\\n\\n## Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nThe third method of reasoning, _abduction_, is defined as \"a [syllogism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syllogism) in which the major premise is evident but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion only probable.\" Basically, it involves forming a conclusion from the information that is known. A familiar example of abduction is a detective\\'s identification of a criminal by piecing together evidence at a crime scene. In an everyday scenario, you may be puzzled by a half-eaten sandwich on the kitchen counter. Abduction will lead you to the best explanation. Your reasoning might be that your teenage son made the sandwich and then saw that he was late for work. In a rush, he put the sandwich on the counter and left.\\n\\nIf you have trouble differentiating _deduction_, _induction_, and _abduction_, thinking about their roots might help. All three words are based on Latin _ducere_, meaning \"to lead.\" The prefix _[de-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/de-)_ means \"from,\" and deduction derives _from_ generally accepted statements or facts. The prefix _[in-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-)_ means \"to\" or \"toward,\" and induction leads you _to_ a generalization. The prefix _[ab-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ab-)_ means \"away,\" and you take _away_ the best explanation in abduction.\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/ \"Merriam Webster\")\\n\\n#### [Word of the Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n#### [ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n[![Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/images/svg/audio.svg)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=e&file=ecstat01 \"Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic\")\\n\\n[See Definitions and Examples](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) »\\n\\n\\nGet Word of the Day daily email!\\n\\n## Games & Quizzes\\n\\n[See All](https://www.merriam-webster.com/games)\\n\\n[![Play Quordle: Guess all four words in a limited number of tries.

If a beverage is defined as \"drinkable through a straw,\" one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage. Inductive reasoning, or _induction_, is making an inference based on an observation, and often an observation of a sample. You can induce that the soup is tasty if you observe all of your friends happily consuming it. Abductive reasoning, or _abduction_, is making a probable conclusion from what you know. If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup on the table, you can use abduction to conclude the owner of the soup is likely returning soon.\\n\\nDo you have to figure out what time you need to leave your house for an appointment? Or are you trying to decide the best choice for lunch? Or are you baffled about why a half-eaten sandwich is on the counter? These situations call for some method of reasoning, and there are three that we use daily: [_deduction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduction), [_induction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induction), and _abduction_.\\n\\n![hot dog](https://merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/images/article/art-wap-article-main/hot-dog-2616-5d6d762c31b7b116b204cc8a3286d7c6@2x.jpg)\\n\\nIn abductive reasoning, the major premise is evident, but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion are only probable. For example, if you find a half-eaten sandwich in your home, you might use probability to reason that your teenage son made the sandwich, realized he was late for work, and abandoned it before he could finish it.\\n\\n## Deductive Reasoning\\n\\n_Deduction_ is generally defined as \"the deriving of a conclusion by reasoning.\" Its specific meaning in [logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic) is \" [inference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inference) in which the conclusion about particulars follows necessarily from general or universal [premises](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premise).\" Simply put, deduction—or the process of [deducing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduce)—is the formation of a conclusion based on generally accepted statements or facts. It occurs when you are planning out trips, for instance. Say you have a 10 o\\'clock appointment with the dentist and you know that it takes 30 minutes to drive from your house to the dentist\\'s. From those two facts, you deduce that you will have to leave your house at 9:30, at the latest, to be at the dentist\\'s on time.\\n\\nDeductive reasoning always follows necessarily from general or universal premises. If a sandwich is defined as \"two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between,\" and a hot dog is defined as \"a frankfurter; especially : a frankfurter heated and served in a long split roll\" then one must deduce that [any hot dog served in a split roll is a sandwich](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/to-chew-on-10-kinds-of-sandwiches/hot-dog).\\n\\n## Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nWhereas in deduction the truth of the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the statements or facts considered (the hot dog is served in a split roll and a split roll with a filling in the middle is a sandwich), induction is a method of reasoning involving an element of [probability](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/probability). In logic, _induction_ refers specifically to \"inference of a generalized conclusion from particular instances.\" In other words, it means forming a generalization based on what is known or observed. For example, at lunch you observe 4 of your 6 coworkers ordering the same sandwich. From your observation, you then [induce](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induce) that the sandwich is probably good—and you decide to try it yourself. Induction is at play here since your reasoning is based on an observation of a small group, as opposed to universal premises.\\n\\n## Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nThe third method of reasoning, _abduction_, is defined as \"a [syllogism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syllogism) in which the major premise is evident but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion only probable.\" Basically, it involves forming a conclusion from the information that is known. A familiar example of abduction is a detective\\'s identification of a criminal by piecing together evidence at a crime scene. In an everyday scenario, you may be puzzled by a half-eaten sandwich on the kitchen counter. Abduction will lead you to the best explanation. Your reasoning might be that your teenage son made the sandwich and then saw that he was late for work. In a rush, he put the sandwich on the counter and left.\\n\\nIf you have trouble differentiating _deduction_, _induction_, and _abduction_, thinking about their roots might help. All three words are based on Latin _ducere_, meaning \"to lead.\" The prefix _[de-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/de-)_ means \"from,\" and deduction derives _from_ generally accepted statements or facts. The prefix _[in-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-)_ means \"to\" or \"toward,\" and induction leads you _to_ a generalization. The prefix _[ab-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ab-)_ means \"away,\" and you take _away_ the best explanation in abduction.\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/ \"Merriam Webster\")\\n\\n#### [Word of the Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n#### [ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n[![Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/images/svg/audio.svg)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=e&file=ecstat01 \"Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic\")\\n\\n[See Definitions and Examples](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) »\\n\\n\\nGet Word of the Day daily email!\\n\\n## Games & Quizzes\\n\\n[See All](https://www.merriam-webster.com/games)\\n\\n[![Play Quordle: Guess all four words in a limited number of tries.

Three methods of reasoning are the deductive, inductive, and abductive approaches.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning: conclusion guaranteed**\\n\\nDeductive reasoning starts with the assertion of a general rule and proceeds from there to a guaranteed specific conclusion. Deductive reasoning moves from the general rule to the specific application: In deductive reasoning, if the original assertions are true, then the conclusion must also be true. For example, math is deductive:\\n\\n_If x = 4_\\n\\n_And if y = 1_\\n\\n_Then 2x + y = 9_\\n\\nIn this example, it is a _logical necessity_ that 2x + y equals 9; 2x + y _must_ equal 9. As a matter of fact, formal, symbolic logic uses a language that looks rather like the math equality above, complete with its own operators and syntax. But a deductive _syllogism_ (think of it as a plain-English version of a math equality) can be expressed in ordinary language:\\n\\n_If entropy (disorder) in a system will increase unless energy is expended,_\\n\\n_And if my living room is a system,_\\n\\n_Then disorder will increase in my living room unless I clean it._\\n\\nIn the syllogism above, the first two statements, the _propositions_ or _premises_, lead logically to the third statement, the _conclusion_. Here is another example:\\n\\n_A medical technology ought to be funded if it has been used successfully to treat patients._\\n\\n_Adult stem cells are being used to treat patients successfully in more than sixty-five new therapies._\\n\\n_Adult stem cell research and technology should be funded._\\n\\nA conclusion is _sound_ (true) or _unsound_ (false), depending on the truth of the original premises (for any premise may be true or false). At the same time, independent of the truth or falsity of the premises, the _deductive inference_ itself (the process of \"connecting the dots\" from premise to conclusion) is either _valid_ or _invalid_. The inferential _process_ can be valid even if the premise is false:\\n\\n_There is no such thing as drought in the West._\\n\\n_California is in the West._\\n\\n_California need never make plans to deal with a drought._\\n\\nIn the example above, though the inferential process itself is valid, the conclusion is false because the premise, _There is no such thing as drought in the West_, is false. A syllogism yields a false conclusion if either of its propositions is false. A syllogism like this is particularly insidious because it looks so very logical–it is, in fact, logical. But whether in error or malice, if either of the propositions above is wrong, then a policy decision based upon it ( _California need never make plans to deal with a drought_) probably would fail to serve the public interest.\\n\\nAssuming the propositions are sound, the rather stern logic of deductive reasoning can give you absolutely certain conclusions. However, deductive reasoning cannot really increase human knowledge (it is _nonampliative_) because the conclusions yielded by deductive reasoning are _tautologies_-statements that are contained within the premises and virtually self-evident. Therefore, while with deductive reasoning we can make observations and expand implications, we cannot make predictions about future or otherwise non-observed phenomena.\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning: conclusion merely likely** Inductive reasoning begins with observations that are specific and limited in scope, and proceeds to a generalized conclusion that is likely, but not certain, in light of accumulated evidence.

This is because there is no way to know that all the possible evidence has been gathered, and that there exists no further bit of unobserved evidence that might invalidate my hypothesis.

Three methods of reasoning are the deductive, inductive, and abductive approaches.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning: conclusion guaranteed**\\n\\nDeductive reasoning starts with the assertion of a general rule and proceeds from there to a guaranteed specific conclusion. Deductive reasoning moves from the general rule to the specific application: In deductive reasoning, if the original assertions are true, then the conclusion must also be true. For example, math is deductive:\\n\\n_If x = 4_\\n\\n_And if y = 1_\\n\\n_Then 2x + y = 9_\\n\\nIn this example, it is a _logical necessity_ that 2x + y equals 9; 2x + y _must_ equal 9. As a matter of fact, formal, symbolic logic uses a language that looks rather like the math equality above, complete with its own operators and syntax. But a deductive _syllogism_ (think of it as a plain-English version of a math equality) can be expressed in ordinary language:\\n\\n_If entropy (disorder) in a system will increase unless energy is expended,_\\n\\n_And if my living room is a system,_\\n\\n_Then disorder will increase in my living room unless I clean it._\\n\\nIn the syllogism above, the first two statements, the _propositions_ or _premises_, lead logically to the third statement, the _conclusion_. Here is another example:\\n\\n_A medical technology ought to be funded if it has been used successfully to treat patients._\\n\\n_Adult stem cells are being used to treat patients successfully in more than sixty-five new therapies._\\n\\n_Adult stem cell research and technology should be funded._\\n\\nA conclusion is _sound_ (true) or _unsound_ (false), depending on the truth of the original premises (for any premise may be true or false). At the same time, independent of the truth or falsity of the premises, the _deductive inference_ itself (the process of \"connecting the dots\" from premise to conclusion) is either _valid_ or _invalid_. The inferential _process_ can be valid even if the premise is false:\\n\\n_There is no such thing as drought in the West._\\n\\n_California is in the West._\\n\\n_California need never make plans to deal with a drought._\\n\\nIn the example above, though the inferential process itself is valid, the conclusion is false because the premise, _There is no such thing as drought in the West_, is false. A syllogism yields a false conclusion if either of its propositions is false. A syllogism like this is particularly insidious because it looks so very logical–it is, in fact, logical. But whether in error or malice, if either of the propositions above is wrong, then a policy decision based upon it ( _California need never make plans to deal with a drought_) probably would fail to serve the public interest.\\n\\nAssuming the propositions are sound, the rather stern logic of deductive reasoning can give you absolutely certain conclusions. However, deductive reasoning cannot really increase human knowledge (it is _nonampliative_) because the conclusions yielded by deductive reasoning are _tautologies_-statements that are contained within the premises and virtually self-evident. Therefore, while with deductive reasoning we can make observations and expand implications, we cannot make predictions about future or otherwise non-observed phenomena.\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning: conclusion merely likely** Inductive reasoning begins with observations that are specific and limited in scope, and proceeds to a generalized conclusion that is likely, but not certain, in light of accumulated evidence. You could say that inductive reasoning moves from the specific to the general. Much scientific research is carried out by the inductive method: gathering evidence, seeking patterns, and forming a hypothesis or theory to explain what is seen.\\n\\nConclusions reached by the inductive method are not logical necessities; no amount of inductive evidence guarantees the conclusion.

It can also be called inference to the best explanation because the goal of abductive reasoning is to ascertain which of the explanations under consideration is the best or most plausible.\\n\\n### What is abductive reasoning used for?\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is used for many different things. It can be used in every situation in which someone seeks to explain evidence of any kind. Therefore, the uses of abductive reasoning include many situations throughout daily life, as well as in science and other fields.\\n\\n### What is an abductive reasoning example?\\n\\nAn example of abductive reasoning would be if someone heard birdsong outside their window and concluded that a bird was probably nearby. There are other potential explanations, such as the possibility that a person is playing audio of birdsong from a speaker, but the explanation that there is a bird outside seems more reasonable, and is more likely to be true in most situations. The process of determining which of these potential explanations makes more sense is abductive reasoning.\\n\\n[Create an account](https://study.com/academy/plans.html)\\n\\nLessonTranscript\\n\\nVideo [Quiz](https://study.com/academy/practice/quiz-worksheet-abductive-reasoning.html) [Course](https://study.com/academy/course/contemporary-math-course.html)\\n\\n![](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/carrrhfke6.jpg)\\n\\n![Video Thumbnail](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html)\\n\\nClick for sound\\n\\n3:48\\n\\n![](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/carrrhfke6.jpg)\\n\\n## You must cCreate an account to continue\\xa0watching\\n\\n### Register to view this lesson\\n\\nAre you a student or a teacher?\\n\\nI am a student\\n\\nI am a teacher\\n\\n\\nCreate Your Account To Continue Watching\\n\\nAs a member, you\\'ll also get unlimited access to over 88,000\\nlessons in math, English, science, history, and more.

reasoning that occurs when a person observes particular evidence and determines what explanation accounts for those facts in the best way. Given some observations of the world that a person wants to explain, they come up with hypotheses, or potential explanations of why the observed facts are the way that they are. Abduction allows a person to conclude that one of those hypotheses is true, or likely true, because it makes more sense than the others, based on various possible criteria; for example, a hypothesis might seem simpler, or could seem more plausible given background knowledge that a person has. The conclusion of an abductive argument is therefore a logical assumption.\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is a form of inference, which involves concluding that a certain claim is true based on one\\'s knowledge of other claims. Abductive reasoning can therefore also be called abductive inference. It can also be called abductive logic because it involves using reason or logic to reach conclusions. Another term for abductive reasoning is abductive argument because abduction involves an argument that some conclusion is true. Abductive reasoning is also known as \\'\\'Inference to the Best Explanation.\\'\\'\\n\\nAbductive reasoning can be compared to another type of inference called **deductive reasoning**. A key difference between the two is that if a deductive argument is structured properly and is made up of true claims or premises, then its conclusion has to be true based on the laws of logic. In an abductive argument, on the other hand, the conclusion is considered to be true or likely true, but it does not have to be; it is possible that the best explanation is still false. In other words, the conclusion of a deductive argument is meant to be a certainty, whereas the conclusion of an abductive argument is only a best guess. The differences between abduction and deduction are explained in more detail later in the lesson.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning Examples**\\n\\nPeople use abductive reasoning all the time, even subconsciously, when trying to understand the world around them and make decisions. The following are abductive argument examples.\\n\\nSuppose that a person looks out their window and sees snow on the ground. There are different possible explanations for this evidence. One is that snow fell overnight and covered the ground. Another is that someone used a snow machine to cover the person\\'s lawn with snow. The person who looks outside and sees snow would almost certainly conclude that the first explanation is much better than the second, and therefore infer that snow fell last night. They might use this inference to conclude that they should wear boots on their walk to work, as they would not need to do so if the snow was just placed on their lawn and nowhere else. This is a case of abduction because the person takes observed evidence and figures out which explanation makes the most sense. In such a case, the person probably does not even know that they are using a reasoning process of any kind; they automatically jump to the hypothesis that seems most reasonable.\\n\\nAs another example, suppose that someone is at work in the middle of the day and has a question for a coworker, but then they see their coworker leave the building. They might construct several hypotheses as to why the coworker left. Perhaps they are going out for lunch. Perhaps they are leaving for the day because they have an appointment. Perhaps they are quitting their job. Each of these hypotheses would explain why they saw the coworker leave. However, the person might conclude that the best explanation is that the coworker went out for lunch, because they often go out for lunch and they rarely have appointments, and they like their job so they are probably not quitting. In this way, the person could use abduction to conclude that their coworker is probably going out for lunch. This might cause them to conclude that they should wait until the coworker gets back to ask the question.\\n\\nMany scholars also think that scientific reasoning frequently involves abduction. For instance, a famous case of abduction in science involves the discovery of the planet Neptune. Neptune was hypothesized to exist in order to explain why Uranus had such a strange orbit; the presence of Neptune would explain this because it pulls on Uranus and changes its path. This is a case of abduction because, given the evidence of Uranus\\'s orbit, there were multiple explanations; for example, it could also have been true that Uranus had a strange orbit because the laws of gravity were misunderstood. However, that would be an extreme conclusion, so Neptune\\'s existence seemed like a better explanation, and of course turned out to be true.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![Abductive reasoning led to the hypothesis that an eighth planet, Neptune, was changing the orbit of Uranus.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/neptune_full481453428272912254.jpg) |\\n\\nThe discovery of Neptune is an example of the importance of abductive reasoning to science.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Deductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning,** or deduction, is a type of inference that differs in important ways from abductive reasoning. The central distinction has to do with the structure of a deductive argument. In general, an argument is structured such that the premises lead to the conclusion; premises are simply the claims the argument makes before the final claim, which is the conclusion. If the argument succeeds, it is because the premises are correct and, therefore, the conclusion is also correct. In a deductive argument, the premises make the conclusion logically necessary; that is, the laws of logic ensure that the conclusion is true whenever the premises are. An abductive argument, on the other hand, does not have a conclusion that is logically necessary.\\n\\nAn [example of a deductive argument](https://study.com/learn/lesson/deductive-argument-examples.html) is the following series of claims:\\n\\n- Premise: All galaxies are made of stars.\\n- Premise: The Andromeda Galaxy is a galaxy.\\n- Conclusion: The Andromeda Galaxy is made of stars.\\n\\nThe two premises seem clearly true, based on the definitions of \\'\\'galaxy\\'\\' and \\'\\'Andromeda Galaxy.\\'\\' In that case, the laws of logic make it certain that the conclusion is true as well; it would violate logic if all galaxies had stars, but the Andromeda Galaxy did not have stars.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![One might use deductive reasoning to prove that the Andromeda Galaxy contains stars.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/andromeda_galaxy_26579046521695553672.jpg) |\\n\\nThe argument that all galaxies have stars, and therefore the Andromeda Galaxy must have stars, is an example of deductive reasoning.\\n\\nThe same logical necessity does not apply to an abductive argument. If someone sees snow on the ground outside and concludes that it was snowing last night, it will not violate logic for them to be wrong; it would simply be a strange situation in which some other cause had put snow on their yard.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Inductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning,** or induction, is another type of reasoning that, like abductive reasoning, comes to conclusions that are reasonable inferences but not logically necessary; in this way, deductive and inductive reasoning are opposites. The difference between inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning is that while abduction involves figuring out explanations, induction only involves making predictions or claims. An example of an inductive argument would be the following:\\n\\n- Premise: Most books I have read contain chapters.\\n- Conclusion: This particular book, which I have not read, likely contains chapters.\\n\\nThis is a case of induction rather than abduction because there is no underlying explanation proposed for why books generally contain chapters; the premise is simply used to make a prediction about another book. It is not a case of deduction because the conclusion is fairly strong, but it is not logically necessary: some books don\\'t have chapters, so it is perfectly possible that the unread book does not have chapters.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Lesson Summary**\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning**, also known as inference to the best explanation, is a method of reasoning that involves inferring which of several explanations for particular observed facts is the most compelling one. An abductive argument is used to make a logical assumption or a best guess, so its conclusion might be false. Abductive reasoning is important in everyday life, as people constantly try to account for their observations of the world; it is also important in scientific study. An example of an abductive argument would be the claim that some particular cause is probably responsible for the things that someone has observed. Abductive reasoning can be distinguished from two other types of inference: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. An argument that employs **deductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is necessarily true if the argument succeeds. An example of a deductive argument would be the claim that since a particular object falls within a given category, and every object in that category has a certain trait, this particular object must have the trait as well. An argument that employs **inductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is not necessarily true but is simply likely or well-supported; unlike abductive reasoning, however, inductive reasoning does not involve explanations. An example of an inductive argument would be the claim that since most or all of the objects a person has observed within a given category have some feature, other objects they have not observed in that category must have the feature as well.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n## Video Transcript\\n\\n## What Is Abductive Reasoning?\\n\\nYou have a cough, a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a runny nose, chills, an aching body, nausea and diarrhea. You have had these symptoms for five days. Given this information, your best guess is that you have influenza, or the flu. But you are not completely certain. This is an example of abductive reasoning.\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is to abduce (or take away) a logical assumption, explanation, inference, conclusion, hypothesis, or best guess from an observation or set of observations. Because the conclusion is merely a best guess, the conclusion that is drawn may or may not be true. Let\\'s look at some examples to gain a better understanding of this reasoning process.\\n\\n## Examples of Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nJury duty decisions are one example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re a juror and the defendant looks like the image of the man on the security camera robbing the bank. He stutters and pauses, like he is guilty, when answering questions posed by the prosecutor. You conclude, as a juror on your first day as a member of the jury, that he is guilty, but you are not certain. Here, you have made a decision based on your observations, but you are not certain it is the right decision.\\n\\nDaily decision-making is also an example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re stuck in traffic on the interstate and see ambulance and police lights about a half mile ahead. There is an exit coming up and you could take some backroads and then get back on the interstate after the accident. You listen to the traffic report on the radio. You look and see if the exit looks congested. Taking all the information at hand, you make the decision to stay on the interstate and wait for the accident to clear. You made the best decision you could given all of the observations.\\n\\n## Deductive & Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nSo, abductive reasoning is really taking an incomplete or partial list of observations about a situation and drawing an inference from these observations. It is an informal process. We use it in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. This reasoning moves from the general to the specific. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. Here is an example:\\n\\nIt is a general rule that all reptiles have scales. If an iguana is a reptile, what specific conclusion can you draw from the above general rule? Your specific conclusion would be that iguanas have scales.\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning** moves from the specific to the general, which is the opposite of deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning, which gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true. Here is an example where the general conclusion that is drawn is most likely incorrect:\\n\\nYour specific observation is that a baby didn\\'t like peaches or apples. Your general conclusion is that the baby won\\'t like any type of fruit.\\n\\n## Lesson Summary\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is a logical assumption formed by observations and which is turned into a hypothesis. In abductive reasoning, the conclusion that is drawn is merely an educated guess or hypothesis and is, therefore, not absolutely verifiable or true. We use a lot of abductive reasoning in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. **Inductive reasoning**, however, moves from the specific to the general and is the opposite of deductive reasoning. It is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning that gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true.\\n\\nContemporary Math\\n\\n9 chapters\\n\\n106 lessons\\n\\nStart today.

It can also be called inference to the best explanation because the goal of abductive reasoning is to ascertain which of the explanations under consideration is the best or most plausible.\\n\\n### What is abductive reasoning used for?\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is used for many different things. It can be used in every situation in which someone seeks to explain evidence of any kind. Therefore, the uses of abductive reasoning include many situations throughout daily life, as well as in science and other fields.\\n\\n### What is an abductive reasoning example?\\n\\nAn example of abductive reasoning would be if someone heard birdsong outside their window and concluded that a bird was probably nearby. There are other potential explanations, such as the possibility that a person is playing audio of birdsong from a speaker, but the explanation that there is a bird outside seems more reasonable, and is more likely to be true in most situations. The process of determining which of these potential explanations makes more sense is abductive reasoning.\\n\\n[Create an account](https://study.com/academy/plans.html)\\n\\nLessonTranscript\\n\\nVideo [Quiz](https://study.com/academy/practice/quiz-worksheet-abductive-reasoning.html) [Course](https://study.com/academy/course/contemporary-math-course.html)\\n\\n![](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/carrrhfke6.jpg)\\n\\n![Video Thumbnail](https://study.com/academy/lesson/abductive-reasoning-definition-examples.html)\\n\\nClick for sound\\n\\n3:48\\n\\n![](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/carrrhfke6.jpg)\\n\\n## You must cCreate an account to continue\\xa0watching\\n\\n### Register to view this lesson\\n\\nAre you a student or a teacher?\\n\\nI am a student\\n\\nI am a teacher\\n\\n\\nCreate Your Account To Continue Watching\\n\\nAs a member, you\\'ll also get unlimited access to over 88,000\\nlessons in math, English, science, history, and more.

reasoning that occurs when a person observes particular evidence and determines what explanation accounts for those facts in the best way. Given some observations of the world that a person wants to explain, they come up with hypotheses, or potential explanations of why the observed facts are the way that they are. Abduction allows a person to conclude that one of those hypotheses is true, or likely true, because it makes more sense than the others, based on various possible criteria; for example, a hypothesis might seem simpler, or could seem more plausible given background knowledge that a person has. The conclusion of an abductive argument is therefore a logical assumption.\\n\\nAbductive reasoning is a form of inference, which involves concluding that a certain claim is true based on one\\'s knowledge of other claims. Abductive reasoning can therefore also be called abductive inference. It can also be called abductive logic because it involves using reason or logic to reach conclusions. Another term for abductive reasoning is abductive argument because abduction involves an argument that some conclusion is true. Abductive reasoning is also known as \\'\\'Inference to the Best Explanation.\\'\\'\\n\\nAbductive reasoning can be compared to another type of inference called **deductive reasoning**. A key difference between the two is that if a deductive argument is structured properly and is made up of true claims or premises, then its conclusion has to be true based on the laws of logic. In an abductive argument, on the other hand, the conclusion is considered to be true or likely true, but it does not have to be; it is possible that the best explanation is still false. In other words, the conclusion of a deductive argument is meant to be a certainty, whereas the conclusion of an abductive argument is only a best guess. The differences between abduction and deduction are explained in more detail later in the lesson.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning Examples**\\n\\nPeople use abductive reasoning all the time, even subconsciously, when trying to understand the world around them and make decisions. The following are abductive argument examples.\\n\\nSuppose that a person looks out their window and sees snow on the ground. There are different possible explanations for this evidence. One is that snow fell overnight and covered the ground. Another is that someone used a snow machine to cover the person\\'s lawn with snow. The person who looks outside and sees snow would almost certainly conclude that the first explanation is much better than the second, and therefore infer that snow fell last night. They might use this inference to conclude that they should wear boots on their walk to work, as they would not need to do so if the snow was just placed on their lawn and nowhere else. This is a case of abduction because the person takes observed evidence and figures out which explanation makes the most sense. In such a case, the person probably does not even know that they are using a reasoning process of any kind; they automatically jump to the hypothesis that seems most reasonable.\\n\\nAs another example, suppose that someone is at work in the middle of the day and has a question for a coworker, but then they see their coworker leave the building. They might construct several hypotheses as to why the coworker left. Perhaps they are going out for lunch. Perhaps they are leaving for the day because they have an appointment. Perhaps they are quitting their job. Each of these hypotheses would explain why they saw the coworker leave. However, the person might conclude that the best explanation is that the coworker went out for lunch, because they often go out for lunch and they rarely have appointments, and they like their job so they are probably not quitting. In this way, the person could use abduction to conclude that their coworker is probably going out for lunch. This might cause them to conclude that they should wait until the coworker gets back to ask the question.\\n\\nMany scholars also think that scientific reasoning frequently involves abduction. For instance, a famous case of abduction in science involves the discovery of the planet Neptune. Neptune was hypothesized to exist in order to explain why Uranus had such a strange orbit; the presence of Neptune would explain this because it pulls on Uranus and changes its path. This is a case of abduction because, given the evidence of Uranus\\'s orbit, there were multiple explanations; for example, it could also have been true that Uranus had a strange orbit because the laws of gravity were misunderstood. However, that would be an extreme conclusion, so Neptune\\'s existence seemed like a better explanation, and of course turned out to be true.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![Abductive reasoning led to the hypothesis that an eighth planet, Neptune, was changing the orbit of Uranus.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/neptune_full481453428272912254.jpg) |\\n\\nThe discovery of Neptune is an example of the importance of abductive reasoning to science.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Deductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning,** or deduction, is a type of inference that differs in important ways from abductive reasoning. The central distinction has to do with the structure of a deductive argument. In general, an argument is structured such that the premises lead to the conclusion; premises are simply the claims the argument makes before the final claim, which is the conclusion. If the argument succeeds, it is because the premises are correct and, therefore, the conclusion is also correct. In a deductive argument, the premises make the conclusion logically necessary; that is, the laws of logic ensure that the conclusion is true whenever the premises are. An abductive argument, on the other hand, does not have a conclusion that is logically necessary.\\n\\nAn [example of a deductive argument](https://study.com/learn/lesson/deductive-argument-examples.html) is the following series of claims:\\n\\n- Premise: All galaxies are made of stars.\\n- Premise: The Andromeda Galaxy is a galaxy.\\n- Conclusion: The Andromeda Galaxy is made of stars.\\n\\nThe two premises seem clearly true, based on the definitions of \\'\\'galaxy\\'\\' and \\'\\'Andromeda Galaxy.\\'\\' In that case, the laws of logic make it certain that the conclusion is true as well; it would violate logic if all galaxies had stars, but the Andromeda Galaxy did not have stars.\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| ![One might use deductive reasoning to prove that the Andromeda Galaxy contains stars.](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/andromeda_galaxy_26579046521695553672.jpg) |\\n\\nThe argument that all galaxies have stars, and therefore the Andromeda Galaxy must have stars, is an example of deductive reasoning.\\n\\nThe same logical necessity does not apply to an abductive argument. If someone sees snow on the ground outside and concludes that it was snowing last night, it will not violate logic for them to be wrong; it would simply be a strange situation in which some other cause had put snow on their yard.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Abductive Reasoning vs Inductive Reasoning**\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning,** or induction, is another type of reasoning that, like abductive reasoning, comes to conclusions that are reasonable inferences but not logically necessary; in this way, deductive and inductive reasoning are opposites. The difference between inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning is that while abduction involves figuring out explanations, induction only involves making predictions or claims. An example of an inductive argument would be the following:\\n\\n- Premise: Most books I have read contain chapters.\\n- Conclusion: This particular book, which I have not read, likely contains chapters.\\n\\nThis is a case of induction rather than abduction because there is no underlying explanation proposed for why books generally contain chapters; the premise is simply used to make a prediction about another book. It is not a case of deduction because the conclusion is fairly strong, but it is not logically necessary: some books don\\'t have chapters, so it is perfectly possible that the unread book does not have chapters.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n**Lesson Summary**\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning**, also known as inference to the best explanation, is a method of reasoning that involves inferring which of several explanations for particular observed facts is the most compelling one. An abductive argument is used to make a logical assumption or a best guess, so its conclusion might be false. Abductive reasoning is important in everyday life, as people constantly try to account for their observations of the world; it is also important in scientific study. An example of an abductive argument would be the claim that some particular cause is probably responsible for the things that someone has observed. Abductive reasoning can be distinguished from two other types of inference: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. An argument that employs **deductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is necessarily true if the argument succeeds. An example of a deductive argument would be the claim that since a particular object falls within a given category, and every object in that category has a certain trait, this particular object must have the trait as well. An argument that employs **inductive reasoning** has a conclusion that is not necessarily true but is simply likely or well-supported; unlike abductive reasoning, however, inductive reasoning does not involve explanations. An example of an inductive argument would be the claim that since most or all of the objects a person has observed within a given category have some feature, other objects they have not observed in that category must have the feature as well.\\n\\nBecome a member to unlock this lesson\\nCreate an account\\n\\n\\n## Video Transcript\\n\\n## What Is Abductive Reasoning?\\n\\nYou have a cough, a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a runny nose, chills, an aching body, nausea and diarrhea. You have had these symptoms for five days. Given this information, your best guess is that you have influenza, or the flu. But you are not completely certain. This is an example of abductive reasoning.\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is to abduce (or take away) a logical assumption, explanation, inference, conclusion, hypothesis, or best guess from an observation or set of observations. Because the conclusion is merely a best guess, the conclusion that is drawn may or may not be true. Let\\'s look at some examples to gain a better understanding of this reasoning process.\\n\\n## Examples of Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nJury duty decisions are one example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re a juror and the defendant looks like the image of the man on the security camera robbing the bank. He stutters and pauses, like he is guilty, when answering questions posed by the prosecutor. You conclude, as a juror on your first day as a member of the jury, that he is guilty, but you are not certain. Here, you have made a decision based on your observations, but you are not certain it is the right decision.\\n\\nDaily decision-making is also an example of abductive reasoning. Let\\'s say you\\'re stuck in traffic on the interstate and see ambulance and police lights about a half mile ahead. There is an exit coming up and you could take some backroads and then get back on the interstate after the accident. You listen to the traffic report on the radio. You look and see if the exit looks congested. Taking all the information at hand, you make the decision to stay on the interstate and wait for the accident to clear. You made the best decision you could given all of the observations.\\n\\n## Deductive & Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nSo, abductive reasoning is really taking an incomplete or partial list of observations about a situation and drawing an inference from these observations. It is an informal process. We use it in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. This reasoning moves from the general to the specific. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. Here is an example:\\n\\nIt is a general rule that all reptiles have scales. If an iguana is a reptile, what specific conclusion can you draw from the above general rule? Your specific conclusion would be that iguanas have scales.\\n\\n**Inductive reasoning** moves from the specific to the general, which is the opposite of deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning, which gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true. Here is an example where the general conclusion that is drawn is most likely incorrect:\\n\\nYour specific observation is that a baby didn\\'t like peaches or apples. Your general conclusion is that the baby won\\'t like any type of fruit.\\n\\n## Lesson Summary\\n\\n**Abductive reasoning** is a logical assumption formed by observations and which is turned into a hypothesis. In abductive reasoning, the conclusion that is drawn is merely an educated guess or hypothesis and is, therefore, not absolutely verifiable or true. We use a lot of abductive reasoning in daily decision-making.\\n\\n**Deductive reasoning**, on the other hand, is a precise conclusion based on a general rule that is known to be true. The conclusion that you draw in deductive reasoning is always accurate and true. **Inductive reasoning**, however, moves from the specific to the general and is the opposite of deductive reasoning. It is taking a specific observation and drawing a general conclusion from it. Unlike deductive reasoning that gives you an accurate conclusion, inductive reasoning yields a conclusion that is not always true.\\n\\nContemporary Math\\n\\n9 chapters\\n\\n106 lessons\\n\\nStart today.

IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\nThe Basic IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\n## The Basic Idea\\n\\nThe scientific method begins with a hypothesis—an educated guess. After making some sort of observation about the world, scientists come up with a potential explanation, which they put to the test using cleverly-designed experiments. But until there’s data to back them up, hypotheses are just stabs in the dark: they might be accurate, but they also might not be.\\n\\nThe generation of hypotheses relies on a particular kind of logical inference, known as\\xa0**abductive reasoning**, abduction, “inference to the best explanation,” or, simply, “hypothesis.” Alongside its sisters, deductive (“top-down”) reasoning and inductive (“bottom-up”) reasoning, abductive reasoning is a core component of the methodology of science, and although it cannot itself be the basis for any sort of conclusions about the world, it represents the crucial first step towards that end.\\n\\n“\\n\\n> **_Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.._**\\n>\\n> **\\\\- Charles Peirce1**\\n\\n## History\\n\\nAbductive reasoning was coined by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce around 1865.1,2\\xa0Up until this point, philosophers had divided logical arguments into two subclasses. First, you have deduction, or “necessary inference,” where a specific conclusion follows from a general rule. For example, given the premises “All men are mortal” and\\xa0 “Socrates is a man,” deductive reasoning leads us to the conclusion that Socrates must be mortal. Deduction results in “necessary” inferences because it is always correct: it’s about taking rules that apply to a wider population and inferring that they also apply to a random sample.2\\n\\nIn contrast, induction is a type of “probable” inference, extrapolating a general rule based on specific examples. For instance, given the premises “Socrates is a man” and “Socrates is mortal,” induction leads us to the generalized conclusion that “All men are mortal.” This process is the inverse of deduction, making an argument about a population based on a smaller sample, which can often lead to incorrect conclusions.\\n\\nDeduction and induction capture many of the logical arguments that a person can make, but Charles Sanders Peirce noticed that there was a type of argument that didn’t fit into either of these categories. Imagine, for example, that you go out for a walk, and you notice that the grass is wet. As a first premise, you know that when it rains, the grass gets wet; and as a second premise, you know that the grass is currently wet. You might be tempted to argue that, therefore, it must have rained. There’s a strong possibility that this is the case—but it’s also not the only possible explanation for the grass being wet. This could also be because, say, somebody had their sprinkler on earlier. You’ve made an educated guess, but it is not the sole conclusion to be drawn. This “best guess” reasoning is what Peirce called\\xa0_abduction_.2\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the most important function of abduction is\\xa0 as a component of the scientific method. Peirce, as a scientist himself, integrated the three forms of logical argument—deduction, induction, and now abduction—into one comprehensive methodology for seeking the truth: the scientific method.2 After _abducting_ a hypothesis, probably after making some sort of surprising observation, scientists use deduction to help them figure out how to test their theory, coming up with one or more necessary inferences that would have to prove true if the hypothesis were correct. Finally, researchers engage in induction, running an experiment and making a probable inference in order to explain its results.2\\n\\n## Controversies\\n\\nWhen Peirce introduced the concept of abduction, he envisioned it, alongside deduction and induction, as forming a logical trichotomy—a distinct, three-phase approach to a better understanding of reality. He thought of these processes as the basic building blocks of reason, each being irreducible to another. In other words, he thought of them as totally distinct logical operations. However, not all philosophers agree that abduction is its own, unique type of logical reasoning. Instead, some have argued that abductive arguments can actually be broken down into deductive and [inductive reasoning](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/inductive-reasoning).3\\n\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27180%27%20height=%27180%27/%3e)![](https://thedecisionlab.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.prismic.io%2Fthedecisionlab%2FZv45b7VsGrYSwUtA_ZpC9CR5LeNNTxFSY_Group657323571.webp%3Fauto%3Dformat%2Ccompress&w=384&q=75)\\n\\n### behavior change 101\\n\\n# Start your behavior change journey at the right place\\n\\n[What is behavior change? ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/what-is-behavior-change) [Learn the tools of the trade ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/tools-of-the-trade) [Frameworks for lasting change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-frameworks) [Behavior change in action ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-in-action) [Making a career of beh change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/making-a-career-of-behavior-change) [See real world examples ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/) [Advanced concepts & trends ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/)\\n\\n## Related TDL content\\n\\n[**TDL Perspectives: Becoming an Applied Behavioral Scientist**](https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/education/tdl-perspectives-becoming-a-behavioral-scientist)\\n\\nApplied behavioral science is all about using the scientific method—abduction, deduction, induction—to find evidence-based solutions to the problems plaguing some kind of system.

IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\nThe Basic IdeaHistoryConsequencesControversiesRelated TDL contentSources\\n\\n## The Basic Idea\\n\\nThe scientific method begins with a hypothesis—an educated guess. After making some sort of observation about the world, scientists come up with a potential explanation, which they put to the test using cleverly-designed experiments. But until there’s data to back them up, hypotheses are just stabs in the dark: they might be accurate, but they also might not be.\\n\\nThe generation of hypotheses relies on a particular kind of logical inference, known as\\xa0**abductive reasoning**, abduction, “inference to the best explanation,” or, simply, “hypothesis.” Alongside its sisters, deductive (“top-down”) reasoning and inductive (“bottom-up”) reasoning, abductive reasoning is a core component of the methodology of science, and although it cannot itself be the basis for any sort of conclusions about the world, it represents the crucial first step towards that end.\\n\\n“\\n\\n> **_Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.._**\\n>\\n> **\\\\- Charles Peirce1**\\n\\n## History\\n\\nAbductive reasoning was coined by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce around 1865.1,2\\xa0Up until this point, philosophers had divided logical arguments into two subclasses. First, you have deduction, or “necessary inference,” where a specific conclusion follows from a general rule. For example, given the premises “All men are mortal” and\\xa0 “Socrates is a man,” deductive reasoning leads us to the conclusion that Socrates must be mortal. Deduction results in “necessary” inferences because it is always correct: it’s about taking rules that apply to a wider population and inferring that they also apply to a random sample.2\\n\\nIn contrast, induction is a type of “probable” inference, extrapolating a general rule based on specific examples. For instance, given the premises “Socrates is a man” and “Socrates is mortal,” induction leads us to the generalized conclusion that “All men are mortal.” This process is the inverse of deduction, making an argument about a population based on a smaller sample, which can often lead to incorrect conclusions.\\n\\nDeduction and induction capture many of the logical arguments that a person can make, but Charles Sanders Peirce noticed that there was a type of argument that didn’t fit into either of these categories. Imagine, for example, that you go out for a walk, and you notice that the grass is wet. As a first premise, you know that when it rains, the grass gets wet; and as a second premise, you know that the grass is currently wet. You might be tempted to argue that, therefore, it must have rained. There’s a strong possibility that this is the case—but it’s also not the only possible explanation for the grass being wet. This could also be because, say, somebody had their sprinkler on earlier. You’ve made an educated guess, but it is not the sole conclusion to be drawn. This “best guess” reasoning is what Peirce called\\xa0_abduction_.2\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the most important function of abduction is\\xa0 as a component of the scientific method. Peirce, as a scientist himself, integrated the three forms of logical argument—deduction, induction, and now abduction—into one comprehensive methodology for seeking the truth: the scientific method.2 After _abducting_ a hypothesis, probably after making some sort of surprising observation, scientists use deduction to help them figure out how to test their theory, coming up with one or more necessary inferences that would have to prove true if the hypothesis were correct. Finally, researchers engage in induction, running an experiment and making a probable inference in order to explain its results.2\\n\\n## Controversies\\n\\nWhen Peirce introduced the concept of abduction, he envisioned it, alongside deduction and induction, as forming a logical trichotomy—a distinct, three-phase approach to a better understanding of reality. He thought of these processes as the basic building blocks of reason, each being irreducible to another. In other words, he thought of them as totally distinct logical operations. However, not all philosophers agree that abduction is its own, unique type of logical reasoning. Instead, some have argued that abductive arguments can actually be broken down into deductive and [inductive reasoning](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/inductive-reasoning).3\\n\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27180%27%20height=%27180%27/%3e)![](https://thedecisionlab.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.prismic.io%2Fthedecisionlab%2FZv45b7VsGrYSwUtA_ZpC9CR5LeNNTxFSY_Group657323571.webp%3Fauto%3Dformat%2Ccompress&w=384&q=75)\\n\\n### behavior change 101\\n\\n# Start your behavior change journey at the right place\\n\\n[What is behavior change? ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/what-is-behavior-change) [Learn the tools of the trade ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/tools-of-the-trade) [Frameworks for lasting change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-frameworks) [Behavior change in action ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/behavior-change-in-action) [Making a career of beh change ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/guide/making-a-career-of-behavior-change) [See real world examples ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/) [Advanced concepts & trends ⮕](https://thedecisionlab.com/)\\n\\n## Related TDL content\\n\\n[**TDL Perspectives: Becoming an Applied Behavioral Scientist**](https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/education/tdl-perspectives-becoming-a-behavioral-scientist)\\n\\nApplied behavioral science is all about using the scientific method—abduction, deduction, induction—to find evidence-based solutions to the problems plaguing some kind of system.

If a beverage is defined as \"drinkable through a straw,\" one could use deduction to determine soup to be a beverage. Inductive reasoning, or _induction_, is making an inference based on an observation, and often an observation of a sample. You can induce that the soup is tasty if you observe all of your friends happily consuming it. Abductive reasoning, or _abduction_, is making a probable conclusion from what you know. If you see an abandoned bowl of hot soup on the table, you can use abduction to conclude the owner of the soup is likely returning soon.\\n\\nDo you have to figure out what time you need to leave your house for an appointment? Or are you trying to decide the best choice for lunch? Or are you baffled about why a half-eaten sandwich is on the counter? These situations call for some method of reasoning, and there are three that we use daily: [_deduction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduction), [_induction_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induction), and _abduction_.\\n\\n![hot dog](https://merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/images/article/art-wap-article-main/hot-dog-2616-5d6d762c31b7b116b204cc8a3286d7c6@2x.jpg)\\n\\nIn abductive reasoning, the major premise is evident, but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion are only probable. For example, if you find a half-eaten sandwich in your home, you might use probability to reason that your teenage son made the sandwich, realized he was late for work, and abandoned it before he could finish it.\\n\\n## Deductive Reasoning\\n\\n_Deduction_ is generally defined as \"the deriving of a conclusion by reasoning.\" Its specific meaning in [logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic) is \" [inference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inference) in which the conclusion about particulars follows necessarily from general or universal [premises](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premise).\" Simply put, deduction—or the process of [deducing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deduce)—is the formation of a conclusion based on generally accepted statements or facts. It occurs when you are planning out trips, for instance. Say you have a 10 o\\'clock appointment with the dentist and you know that it takes 30 minutes to drive from your house to the dentist\\'s. From those two facts, you deduce that you will have to leave your house at 9:30, at the latest, to be at the dentist\\'s on time.\\n\\nDeductive reasoning always follows necessarily from general or universal premises. If a sandwich is defined as \"two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between,\" and a hot dog is defined as \"a frankfurter; especially : a frankfurter heated and served in a long split roll\" then one must deduce that [any hot dog served in a split roll is a sandwich](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/to-chew-on-10-kinds-of-sandwiches/hot-dog).\\n\\n## Inductive Reasoning\\n\\nWhereas in deduction the truth of the conclusion is guaranteed by the truth of the statements or facts considered (the hot dog is served in a split roll and a split roll with a filling in the middle is a sandwich), induction is a method of reasoning involving an element of [probability](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/probability). In logic, _induction_ refers specifically to \"inference of a generalized conclusion from particular instances.\" In other words, it means forming a generalization based on what is known or observed. For example, at lunch you observe 4 of your 6 coworkers ordering the same sandwich. From your observation, you then [induce](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/induce) that the sandwich is probably good—and you decide to try it yourself. Induction is at play here since your reasoning is based on an observation of a small group, as opposed to universal premises.\\n\\n## Abductive Reasoning\\n\\nThe third method of reasoning, _abduction_, is defined as \"a [syllogism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syllogism) in which the major premise is evident but the minor premise and therefore the conclusion only probable.\" Basically, it involves forming a conclusion from the information that is known. A familiar example of abduction is a detective\\'s identification of a criminal by piecing together evidence at a crime scene. In an everyday scenario, you may be puzzled by a half-eaten sandwich on the kitchen counter. Abduction will lead you to the best explanation. Your reasoning might be that your teenage son made the sandwich and then saw that he was late for work. In a rush, he put the sandwich on the counter and left.\\n\\nIf you have trouble differentiating _deduction_, _induction_, and _abduction_, thinking about their roots might help. All three words are based on Latin _ducere_, meaning \"to lead.\" The prefix _[de-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/de-)_ means \"from,\" and deduction derives _from_ generally accepted statements or facts. The prefix _[in-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-)_ means \"to\" or \"toward,\" and induction leads you _to_ a generalization. The prefix _[ab-](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ab-)_ means \"away,\" and you take _away_ the best explanation in abduction.\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/ \"Merriam Webster\")\\n\\n#### [Word of the Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n#### [ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day)\\n\\n[![Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/images/svg/audio.svg)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/deduction-vs-induction-vs-abduction?pronunciation&lang=en_us&dir=e&file=ecstat01 \"Listen to the pronunciation of ecstatic\")\\n\\n[See Definitions and Examples](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) »\\n\\n\\nGet Word of the Day daily email!\\n\\n## Games & Quizzes\\n\\n[See All](https://www.merriam-webster.com/games)\\n\\n[![Play Quordle: Guess all four words in a limited number of tries.
